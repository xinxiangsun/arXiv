The simulations employ a temperature- and composition-dependent tabulated nuclear equation of state, with initially dipolar fields with a maximum initial strength of ${\\sim}10^{16}\\ {\\rm G}$ which extend outside the stars. We employ adaptive mesh refinement and consider three grid resolutions, with grid spacing down to $Δx_{\\rm min} \\simeq 92\\ {\\rm m}$ in the most refined region. When comparing the two highest resolution simulations, we find orbital dephasing of over 7 orbits until merger of only $0.06$ radians. The magnetic field is amplified during the merger and we observe the formation of a magnetized funnel in the polar region of the remnant. Simulations are continued until about $30$ milliseconds after merger. However, due to significant baryonic pollution, the binary fails to produce a magnetically-dominated outflow. Finally, we discuss possible numerical and physical effects that might alter this outcome."}

This paper presents an overview of the simulation framework, detailing its implementation and components. Built upon the GalSim package and incorporating the latest CSST instrumental specifications, our pipeline generates pixel-level mock observations that closely replicate the expected instrumental and observational conditions. The simulation suite integrates realistic astrophysical object catalogs, instrumental effects, point spread function (PSF) modeling, and observational noises to produce accurate synthetic data. We describe the key processing stages of the simulation, from constructing the input object catalogs to modeling the telescope optics and detector responses. Furthermore, we introduce the most recent release of simulated datasets, which provide a crucial testbed for data processing pipeline developments, calibration strategies, and scientific analyses, ensuring that CSST will meet its stringent requirements. Our pipeline serves as a vital tool for optimizing CSST main survey strategies and ensuring robust cosmological measurements."}

Cosmic rays that are accelerated in astrophysical sources can escape from their jets and interact with background radiation fields. Interactions with the extragalactic background light can produce pions and hence neutrinos, while interactions with the cosmic microwave background predominantly drive inverse Compton scattering, contributing to electromagnetic cascades in intergalactic space. The resulting secondary gamma-ray emission can be detected with high-energy gamma-ray telescopes. Here, we report on a new search for such cosmogenic cascade emission from the blazar TXS 0506+056, using a combined data set from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope and VERITAS. We compare the gamma-ray spectrum and neutrino observations with the predictions of cosmic-ray induced cascades in intergalactic space. The observed gamma-ray spectrum is modeled as a combination of the primary spectrum and the cascade spectrum. We apply a Monte Carlo simulation with a $Δχ^2$-based likelihood analysis to jointly determine the best-fit parameters of a proton emission spectrum describing the data and derive constraints on the proton escape luminosity.

The analysis integrates the definition of the mission profile, the instrumental concept architecture, and an error budget that breaks down the key contributors to the sub-micro arcses precision required for a single measurement. A portion of this budget addresses photo-center estimation for both the target and calibration stars used in differential astrometry. Other major contributors are related to instrumental control of systematics in the reconstruction of differential angle measurements from pixel data (focal plane calibration) to on sky line of sight (telescope distortion calibration). End-of-mission astrometry requires multiple observations (typically 100) of the same target distributed over the mission lifetime. We assess the mission profile to estimate the fraction of survey time required for astrometric survey to achieve the science objective. The proposed architecture of the instrument concept is derived from error budget and mission constraints based on a large visible detector array composed of an assembly of multiple CMOS sensor chips resulting in an overall gigapixel focal plane. We evaluate the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and propose a way forward reaching TRL 5 level for key technologies by the Mission Consolidation Review in 2029."}

The long-term MAXI light curve, along with the hardness-intensity diagram (HID) derived from NICER data, indicates that the source remained in the hard state and did not switch to the soft state. Spectral modeling using two different model combinations reveals that the broadband spectrum is best described by two distinct Comptonizing regions, associated reflection components, and thermal emission from the disk. The harder Comptonizing region dominates ($\\gtrsim88\\%$) the total flux and is primarily responsible for the observed reflection features from the distant part of the disk. We find that the accretion disk is truncated at a radius of $\\sim16-56~r_{\\rm{g}}$, while the luminosity is $\\sim1.9\\%$ of the Eddington limit. Our spectral results also show consistency in the estimated inner disk radius obtained through two independent methods: modeling the disk continuum and the reflection spectrum. The variability studies imply the presence of intrinsic disk variability, likely originating from an instability in the disk. We also detect hard time lags at low frequencies, possibly arising from the inward propagation of mass accretion rate fluctuations from the outer to the inner regions of the accretion disk. Moreover, an observed deviation of the lag-energy spectrum from the log-linear trend at $\\lesssim 0.7$ keV is most likely attributed to thermal reverberation, arising from the reprocessing of hard coronal photons in the accretion disk."}

While theoretical models of shadows in vacuum are mature, real astrophysical black holes like M87* and Sgr A* are enveloped in plasma, which can alter photon trajectories through dispersion. Current understanding, based on foundational work, indicates that only specific plasma distributions allow for an analytical treatment via the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we build upon this framework to systematically investigate the propagation of light rays in Kerr spacetime surrounded by a pressureless, non-magnetized cold plasma. We explicitly derive the separability condition, identifying the exact class of plasma densities that permit a generalized Carter constant. For these models, we compute the photon regions and shadow boundaries, characterizing how the shadow's size and shape deviate from the vacuum case in a frequency-dependent manner. Our results provide analytical benchmarks for the distortion of shadows in dispersive media and determine the critical plasma frequency beyond which the shadow is erased, offering a direct link between observable shadow features and the properties of the ambient plasma environment and providing a foundation for studying more dynamic, non-separable plasma distributions."}

Within a general-relativistic two-fluid framework that allows a covariantly conserved, gradient-driven energy exchange between baryons and the dark sector, we quantify how dark microphysics reshapes global structure when the total gravitational radius need not coincide with the luminous baryonic radius. Using a state-of-the-art baryonic equation of state, we explore the halo-forming mass range for fermionic dark matter with particle masses of 400 MeV and 1 GeV, and we characterize sequences by the difference between the total and luminous radii and by the fractional difference between the total and baryonic masses. We confirm established trends: lighter fermions typically support low-density halos that increase the total radius by several kilometers at nearly fixed mass, whereas masses near 1 GeV tend to shrink halos and make the two radii appreciably closer. Our central new result is that a percent-level vacuum-like admixture markedly reduces halo formation, shrinking the radius difference from several kilometers to sub-kilometer scales and the fractional mass difference to $\\lesssim 1\\%$. Combined gravitational-wave and X-ray observations offer a practical route to bound the halo size and the allowed vacuum-like fraction."}

Although core collapse supernovae of isolated massive stars are important, binary interactions -- such as tidal interaction, common envelope evolution, and stellar mergers -- may also play a significant role in making magnetars. Understanding the relative contributions of these channels is crucial for linking magnetars to their observed properties and host environments. In this paper, we investigate potential magnetar formation channels using population synthesis simulations, considering both single-star and isolated binary system evolution. By conducting simulations with different parameters, we compare the effects of various evolution processes on magnetar formation. Additionally, we study the delay times and kick velocities across all formation channels, analyze the orbital properties and companion types of surviving magnetar binaries. We find that the majority of magnetars are observed as single objects ($\\geq 90\\%$), although a large fraction of them were originally in binary systems and experienced either kick disruption or merger. Surviving binaries are most likely to host main-sequence companions and exhibit different distributions of eccentricities due to different supernova mechanisms. These findings show the critical role of binary evolution in magnetar formation and provide predictions for the properties of magnetar populations that can be tested with future observations."}

In this work, we perform a detailed investigation of the outflow--cloud interaction scenario for neutrino production in Seyfert nuclei. In this framework, fast AGN-driven winds collide with clumpy gas clouds in the nuclear region, forming bow shocks that efficiently accelerate cosmic-ray protons. The accelerated protons subsequently interact with cold protons from the outflows via inelastic proton--proton ($pp$) collisions, producing high-energy neutrinos, while the photomeson ($pγ$) process with disk photons may provide a subdominant contribution at the highest energies. Applying this model to five neutrino-associated Seyfert galaxies, we successfully reproduce the observed TeV neutrino fluxes without violating existing gamma-ray constraints. By integrating over the Seyfert population using X-ray luminosity functions, we further demonstrate that Seyfert galaxies can account for a substantial fraction of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino background in the $10^4-10^5~{\\rm GeV}$ energy range."}

The data are then accounted for in a physically motivated, spatially-dependent propagation model. It has been shown that one background source population plus two local sources, or two background source populations plus one local source can well reproduce the measurements. The spectral structures of individual species of cosmic rays are thus natural imprints of different source components of cosmic rays. Combined with ultra-high-energy $γ$-ray observations of various types of sources, the mystery about the origin of Galactic cosmic rays may be uncovered in future."}

By introducing a parametrization of the plasma composition, we establish the general criterion for the occurrence of vacuum resonance in such plasmas. Our analysis encompasses both Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein-like adiabatic mode conversion and nonadiabatic eigenmode transition, highlighting their dependence on the plasma composition. Applying this framework to baryon-loaded fireballs in magnetar bursts, we estimate the characteristic X-ray polarization signatures. Detection of these polarizations will provide observational signatures of vacuum polarization as well as baryon loading in magnetar fireballs."}

Among 164 pulsars with independent distance measurements and 3530 open clusters, we find that 4 pulsars are likely residing in open clusters.

Competing scenarios that seek to determine which of these periods are physical and which are secondary are under debate. The detection of a fifth period, $P_3 = 26.3$ d, was recently claimed. Our aim is to determine which of these periods are intrinsic (likely related to physical processes) and which of these are secondary (resulting from interference). We avoided any assumption about the physical scenario and restricted our analysis to the phenomenology of the radio emission variability. We selected intervals from archival radio data and applied the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We fit the observational data to generate synthetic data that only contain specific signals. We analyzed these synthetic data to assess the impact of these signals and their interference on the light curves and the periodogram. The two-peaked profile, consisting of $P_1$ and $P_2$, was detected in the periodogram of the actual data for intervals that are significantly shorter than $P_{\\rm long}$, provided that these intervals contain a minimum of the long-term modulation. The characteristics of the observational data and their periodogram could only be reproduced with synthetic data if these explicitly included all three periods $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_{\\rm long}$, the residuals being limited by noise.

Their origin and power source remain uncertain. To help address this uncertainty, here we use a template-free reconstruction of ten years of all-sky Fermi/LAT data provided by Platz et al. (2023) to carry out a pixel-by-pixel spectral analysis of the Bubbles. We recover the position-dependent spectral shape and normalization that would be required for parent proton or electron cosmic ray populations to produce the Bubbles' observed gamma-ray spectra. We find that models in which the gamma-ray emission is driven by either hadronic or leptonic processes can explain the data equally well. The cosmic ray population driving the emission must have either broken power-law or exponentially cut-off spectra, with break or cutoff energies that are almost constant with latitude but spectral indices below the break that harden towards the Bubbles' southern tip. For the leptonic channel, reproducing the observed position-dependent gamma-ray spectrum also requires a cosmic ray electron energy density that grows with distance from the Galactic plane and increases towards the edges of the Bubbles. This finding disfavors scenarios for the origin of the Bubbles where a population of cosmic ray electrons is accelerated near the Milky Way center and subsequently advected out to the extremities of the Bubbles."}

Accepted in MNRAS", "summary": "Pulse profile modelling is a relativistic ray-tracing technique that has provided constraints on parameters, with a focus on mass and radius, of five rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. While the technique can also be applied to accretion-powered millisecond pulsars (AMPs), this requires accounting for the X-rays from the accretion disc and has only been applied to archival data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Here, we apply a previously developed neutron star and accretion disc model to the NICER (Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer) data of the 2019 and 2022 outbursts of SAX J1808.4-3658. We find that a single circular hotspot model is insufficient to explain the data. Modelling with two hotspots and an accretion disc model provides better phase-residuals, but a spectral residual at around 1 keV remains. In contrast, we find a good fit with a flexible background approach, replacing the accretion disk. However, the inferred parameters are not robust due to a degeneracy in the origin of the non-pulsed radiation, which can be caused either by the background or a hotspot that is at least partially in view throughout a full rotation. This work represents an important next step in pulse profile modelling of AMPs by analysing NICER data and underlines the need for more accurate accretion disc and hotspot modelling to achieve robust parameter constraints. We expect the inclusion of higher energy and polarimetric data will provide complementary constraints on inclination, hotspot colatitude, and hotspot size, improving the accuracy of pulse profile modelling of AMPs."}

The telescope offered an ideal vantage view of the Southern Sky and benefited from optimal water properties for enhanced angular resolution. This study makes use of data collected over the entire operational period of ANTARES to search for sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos, considering both steady and flaring emission scenarios. First, a time-integrated search for high-energy neutrino clustering across the celestial sphere is conducted. The most significant accumulation is found at coordinates $(α, δ) =(200.5^\\circ\\, 17.7^\\circ)$ with a post-trial p-value equal to 0.38. A dedicated search in the Galactic Plane is also performed for extended sources, yielding no significant excess. Additionally, a list of potential neutrino sources are investigated. The blazar MG3 J225517+2409 is identified as the most significant object, yet the excess remains compatible with background fluctuations. A mild local excess of 2.4$σ$ is found for the blazar TXS 0506+056. The full sky is also examined for the presence of flaring neutrino emissions. The most significant excess in this case corresponds to a $\\sim$4-day flare from the direction $(α, δ) = (141.3^\\circ\\, 9.8^\\circ)$, with a post-trial p-value of 0.30. Finally, the directions of sources highlighted in IceCube's time-dependent searches are investigated. Temporal overlaps between ANTARES and IceCube flares are identified for PKS 1502+106 and TXS 0506+056, with an estimated chance probability of about 0.02%, making this observation particularly noteworthy."}

Alp"], "title": "The position of SN 1987A", "comment": "8 pages, 5 figures. Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "The accurate positional measurement of Supernova (SN) 1987A is important for determining the kick velocity of its compact object and the velocities of the ejecta and various shock components. In this work, we perform absolute astrometry to determine the position of SN 1987A. We used multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope imaging to model the early ejecta and the equatorial ring (ER). We combined our measurements and obtained the celestial coordinates in the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by registering the observations onto Gaia Data Release 3. The final average position of the different measurements is ${α= 5^{\\mathrm{h}}~ 35^{\\rm{m}}~ 27^{\\rm{s}}.9884(30)}$, ${δ= -69^{\\circ}~ 16'~ 11''.1134(136)}$ (ICRS J2016). The early ejecta position is located 14 mas south and 16 mas east of the ER center, with the offset being significant at 96% confidence. The offset may be due to instrument and/or filter-dependent systematics and registration uncertainties, though an intrinsic explosion offset relative to the ER remains possible. Image registration with proper motion corrections yields similar astrometry and a source proper motion of ${μ_{\\rm east} (\\equiv \\rm{PM_{α}*}) = 1.60 \\pm 0.15 ~\\rm{mas ~ yr^{-1}}}$ and ${μ_{\\rm{north}} (\\equiv \\rm{PM_δ}) = 0.44 \\pm 0.09~\\rm{mas ~ yr^{-1}}}$, in agreement with the typical local motion of the Large Magellanic Cloud. The absolute positional uncertainty of 21 mas adds a systematic uncertainty to the sky-plane kick velocity of ${123}~(t/40~\\rm{yr})^{-1}~\\rm{km~s}^{-1}$, where $t$ is the time since the explosion. Comparing the location of the compact source observed with JWST to our updated position implies a sky-plane kick of ${399\\pm148~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ and a 3D kick of ${472\\pm126~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$, which is consistent with previous estimates."}
