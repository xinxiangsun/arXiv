Such objects are expected from\nstandard hierarchical galaxy evolution to form after two galaxies, each\ncontaining a supermassive black hole, have merged, in the centre of the merger\nremnant. A complex interaction is predicted to take place with stars and gas in\nthe host galaxy, leading to observable signatures in weakly as well as actively\naccreting phases. Direct observational evidence is available and shows examples\nof dual active galactic nuclei from kpc scales down to parsec scales.\nSignatures of possibly closer supermassive black hole binaries may be seen in\njetted black holes. The interaction with stars and gas in a galaxy\nsignificantly affects the hardening of the binary and hence contributes to\nuncertainties of the expected gravitational wave signal. The Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should in the future detect actual mergers.\nBefore the launch of LISA, pulsar timing arrays may have the best chance to\ndetect a gravitational wave signal from supermassive black hole binaries.

However, accurate\nmeasurements of their mass outflow rates are challenging due to uncertainties\nin our understanding of the 3D wind structure. Most studies employ absorption\nline spectroscopy that only gives us a single sightline through the wind\nstreamlines. Hercules X-1 is a peculiar X-ray binary which allows us to avoid\nthis issue, as its warped, precessing accretion disk naturally presents a range\nof sightlines through the vertical structure of its disk wind. Here we present\nthe first results from a large, coordinated campaign on Her X-1 led by the new\nXRISM observatory and supported by XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Chandra. We perform a\ntime-resolved analysis and constrain the properties of the wind vertical\nstructure.

The wind\ncolumn density decreases with height, as expected, but its ionization parameter\nonly evolves weakly, and is consistent with freezing out as the wind expands\naway.

Using 18 X-ray/B-band simultaneous XMM-Newton observations (717\nks in total) of the redback system PSR J1023+0038 taken during the LMXB state,\nwe find a general trend that the amplitude of the B-band orbital modulation was\nlower when the observed X-ray flux was higher.

It is commonly assumed that gas accretion\nwill both efficiently spin up disk-embedded black holes and align the orbits of\nembedded binaries with the disk plane, leading to mergers with preferentially\npositive effective spin parameters ($\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$). Such predictions\nhave motivated the use of $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ as a diagnostic for identifying\ncandidate AGN-embedded mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave\ncatalog. In this work, we perform post-Newtonian $N$-body simulations of nearly\nplanar binary-single encounters and apply an empirically motivated, gas-driven\nalignment prescription to characterize the expected\n$\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$-eccentricity correlations of AGN-embedded mergers. By\ncomparing the alignment and gravitational-wave inspiral timescales, we identify\nthe regions of parameter space, across both disk location and binary\nproperties, where full disk-spin-orbit alignment is effective and where it is\nnot. We find that quasi-circular binaries typically align by the time they\nmerge, supporting the standard picture of spin-orbit aligned orientations. By\ncontrast, eccentric binaries (with in-band eccentricity\n$e_{10\\mathrm{Hz}}\\gtrsim 0.1$) typically inspiral too quickly for gas torques\nto act, preserving the post-encounter spin-orbit misalignments and yielding\nmore isotropic $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ distributions when disk densities and\ntorque efficiencies are modest.

Despite a\nrich data set there is, still, no consensus about the physical nature and\norigin of this event. AT 2018cow remained UV bright 2-4 years after the\nexplosion, which points at an additional energy injection source, most likely\nfrom an accretion disk. We present additional late time UV data obtained with\nthe Hubble Space Telescope, to show there is no significant fading in the\noptical since the last epoch and only marginal fading in the UV. The new UV\ndata points match the predictions of previously published accretion disk\nmodels, where the disk is assumed to form from the tidal disruption of a low\nmass star by an intermediate mass black hole. This consistency provides\nevidence that AT 2018cow could indeed be a tidal disruption event. The marginal\ndecay is in contrast with the predictions of light curves produced by\ninteracting supernovae. The difference between expectations for disc emission\nand interacting supernovae will further increase with time, making data at even\nlater times a route to robustly rule out interaction between supernova ejecta\nand circumstellar material."}

However, absorption spectra of galaxies prove rather\nchallenging at high redshift or in low mass galaxies, due to the need to spread\nthe photons into a relatively large set of spectral bins. For this reason, the\ndata from many state-of-the-art spectroscopic surveys suffer from low\nsignal-to-noise (S/N) ratios, and prevent accurate estimates of the stellar\npopulation parameters. In this paper, we tackle the issue of denoising an\nensemble by the use of unsupervised Deep Learning techniques trained on a\nhomogeneous sample of spectra over a wide range of S/N. These methods\nreconstruct spectra at a higher S/N and allow us to investigate the potential\nfor Deep Learning to faithfully reproduce spectra from incomplete data. Our\nmethodology is tested on three key line strengths and is compared with\nsynthetic data to assess retrieval biases. The results suggest a standard\nAutoencoder as a very powerful method that does not introduce systematics in\nthe reconstruction. We also note in this work how careful the analysis needs to\nbe, as other methods can -- on a quick check -- produce spectra that appear\nnoiseless but are in fact strongly biased towards a simple overfitting of the\nnoisy input. Denoising methods with minimal bias will maximise the quality of\nongoing and future spectral surveys such as DESI, WEAVE, or WAVES."}

However, Bayesian\nPPM has faced a hard accuracy-speed bottleneck: current production resolutions\nused to keep inference tractable can under-resolve extreme hotspot geometries\nand bias the waveform computation, whereas the higher resolutions that remove\nthis bias push forward models to minutes per evaluation, making inference\nimpractical. We break this trade-off with, to our knowledge, the first public\nGPU-accelerated X-ray PPM framework that matches established benchmarks to\nwithin $\\sim10^{-3}$ relative accuracy even for extreme geometries, while\ncollapsing minutes-long high-fidelity computations to $2$--$5$ ms on an RTX\n4080 ($10^{3}$--$10^{4}\\times$ speedups), enabling posterior exploration at\nresolutions and complexities previously out of reach. We further uncover a bias\nnear the interpolation boundaries of atmosphere lookup tables, demonstrate it\nwith two diagnostic tests, and counter it with a mixed-order interpolator.\nTogether, these advances enlarge the feasible hotspot model space and reduce\nkey systematics in PPM, strengthening inferences for current and future X-ray\nmissions."}
