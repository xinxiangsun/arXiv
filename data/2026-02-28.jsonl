Gas from the dense disk accretes onto these AMSs, dissipating substantial gravitational energy through a mini-disk around the sMBHs, which drives powerful outflows that interact with the surrounding disk gas. In this study, we investigate two scenarios for AMS accretion: episodic Bondi explosions with hyper-Eddington accretion (Scenario A) and steady Eddington accretion (Scenario B). These outflows generate turbulence, facilitating outward angular momentum transport in the AGN disk via shock interactions and angular momentum exchange. We explore a broad parameter space-spanning the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass ($M_{\\rm p}$), dimensionless accretion rate ($\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}_{\\rm p}$), sMBH mass function, and spatial distribution-to calculate the effective viscosity parameter $α_{\\rm AMS}$.

This work investigates the $ω$ modes of compact stars composed of quarkyonic matter. The quarkyonic model, which describes a cross-over transition between nucleonic and quark matter treated as quasi-particles, is formulated within the Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) theory using the G3 and IOPB-I parameterizations. This core is surrounded by a mantle of hadronic matter, creating a multicomponent stellar interior. The overall Equation of State (EOS) is governed by two key parameters: the transition density ($n_t$), the QCD confinement scale ($Λ_{\\rm cs}$), which are varied to construct models consistent with current astrophysical constraints on mass and radius. We compute the complex eigenfrequencies (damped oscillations) of the fundamental and first excited $ω$ modes using the phase-amplitude method within a full general relativistic framework. Our simulations reveal that the admixed quarkyonic structure produces a unique $ω$ mode signature, distinctly different from pure hadronic or hybrid stars. The spectrum exhibits a strong, degenerate dependence on the EOS, where the stiffening effect of the quarkyonic matter influences oscillation frequencies and damping times in a characteristic manner. We also demonstrate that $ω$ mode frequencies for quarkyonic stars follow approximate universal relations, largely independent of the EOS."}

White dwarf (WD)-IMBH binaries provide a unique probe because they emit both electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves (GWs), thereby conveying richer information. However, such multi-messenger sources often enter the regime of strong gravity, where existing models fail to capture their relativistic dynamics. Here, we develop a fully relativistic model for the tidal response of a WD close to an IMBH and use it to study the secular orbital evolution as well as the GW signal. We find that for IMBHs more massive than 10^5 solar masses, tidal interaction becomes relativistic and sensitive to IMBH spin. The interaction generally dissipates binary orbital energy and angular momentum, but due to relativistic frame rotation, which reduces phase coherence across pericenter passages, the orbit-averaged tidal dissipation rate can be suppressed by up to about 50% relative to Newtonian predictions. Including tidal dissipation leads to more rapid damping of the orbital eccentricity, to the extent that the pericenter distance may even increase over time, potentially explaining quasi-periodic eruptions and secular orbital period growth. Such tidal effects accumulate into measurable phase and amplitude deviations in the GW signal. For typical space-based observations, the GW waveform mismatch can reach values of order 0.1 within 6 months. Our results indicate that relativistic tidal dissipation is both dynamically important and observationally essential for reliably predicting the multi-messenger signals of WD-IMBH systems."}

A longstanding question is whether magnetic flux can accumulate near the event horizon to such an extent that it halts accretion entirely, enabling energy extraction purely from spin. Previous studies have shown that accretion persists through instabilities and that jet power only modestly exceeds the accretion energy budget, yet some observational results suggest much higher efficiencies. Here we present state-of-the-art general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations that sustain a quasi-steady magnetically arrested disk state for approximately 10,000 dynamical times, during which accretion is globally suppressed across the full azimuthal extent. In this regime, jet power exceeds the accretion energy input by more than two orders of magnitude, demonstrating a previously unachieved level of efficiency. These results challenge conventional assumptions about the limits of black hole energy extraction and suggest a new framework for interpreting powerful jet systems. Our findings raise important questions about the long-term stability of such states and the fundamental limits of the Blandford-Znajek process."}

Main Burst versus Extended Emission", "comment": "35 pages, 5 figures (including 71 panels), 7 tables", "summary": "Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) frequently exhibit complex prompt emission structures with multiple temporally distinct episodes, such as a main emission (ME) phase followed by a weak extended emission (EE) tail. Whether these subcomponents from a common physical origin with similar classification properties, or instead represent fundamentally different emission mechanisms within a single event, remains an open question. Here, we present a systematic, pulse-resolved analysis of 22 \\emph{Swift}/BAT long-duration GRBs, each exhibiting a well-separated, bright ME ($G_1$) followed by a fainter EE ($G_2$) after a background-consistent quiescent gap. For each component, we independently measure standard classification diagnostics, including duration ($T_{90}$), spectral hardness ratio (HR), minimum variability timescale (MVT), and spectral lag. We then compare these properties between the ME and EE within individual bursts. We find that the EE is systematically softer (lower HR in 19 of 22 events), smoother (longer MVT in 17 of 22 events), and more diverse in spectral lag than the ME. However, both components still occupy the long-GRB track in the traditional duration-hardness and duration-MVT planes, indicating a common Type~II (collapsar) origin. These results suggest that the EE in long GRBs represents a physically distinct regime of the central engine, characterized by a lower luminosity, longer emission timescales, and evolved spectral properties, rather than a simple continuation of the main burst. This picture is consistent with late-time fallback accretion onto a black hole or proto-magnetar spin-down."}

The timescale of nulling ranges from a few pulse periods to many hours or even days. The fraction of time a nulling pulsar spends in a null state varies across the population of canonical pulsars, from 0 to 95 per cent. The long-term behaviour of a pulsar's nulling fraction, however, is currently unknown, as published values have typically been obtained through single observations. Here, we present the first long-term analysis of nulling behaviour in eight pulsars observed in the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey over the course of eight to ten years. We also apply a new Bayesian method for pulse-energy analysis, yielding posterior estimates of the nulling fraction per observation. In several cases, the nulling affects only specific components of the pulse profile, rather than the entirety of the emission. Our analysis reveals that, while most pulsars show no significant trend in their nulling fraction over time, a subset exhibit some evidence for non-zero gradients in nulling fraction. In particular, PSRs J1048$-$3832, J1745$-$3040, and J1825$-$0935 show statistically significant trends over the span of the data. Studying the behaviour of nulling over years and decades is valuable as it can provide insights into the physical emission processes within pulsars. Studying how nulling evolves also provides valuable insights into pulsar evolution and the characterisation of the broader pulsar population."}

A common origin of SNe in the Iax subclass is still under debate since the distribution of certain observables may indicate that the extremely low-luminosity explosions form a distinct population. We aim to estimate the physical properties of the two EL objects, including mapping the ejecta structure. We perform spectral tomography on the spectral series of SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx around their maxima to map the physical properties of the ejecta. Together with the analysis of BgVriz photometry, a wide range of observables can be studied to investigate their distribution against luminosity. The constrained chemical abundances of the ejecta are compared to the predictions of the hydrodynamic simulations with similar peak luminosities. Constant abundances provide a good match for the distribution of chemical elements for both SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx. The discrepancies compared to the least luminous pure deflagration model N5def_hybrid are minor, especially at post-maximum epochs. The two SNe also share similar characteristics in their constrained density structures, as well as the evolution of the photosphere. The analysis supports the assumption that pure deflagration models can reproduce the main characteristics of SNe Iax, even for the EL population. The presented indirect observational evidence indicates that these objects show similar intrinsic properties to the relatively luminous Iax sample and fit into the velocity distribution of the subclass."}

For constant fields, we derive exact probabilities and identify a perturbative plateau regime where photon survival scales as quartic order of magnetic field, isolating the four-point magnetic correlation as a sensitive probe of non-Gaussianity. For Gaussian stochastic fields, we obtain--for the first time--analytical formulas for non-exponential-decay components in the strong-attenuation regime. Contrary to the widely used domain-like model, photon survival is suppressed by 4-6 orders of magnitude, while both conversion and survival probabilities exhibit distinct multi-peak structures from mass-equal resonance, stochastic resonance, and EBL attenuation. Extending to non-Gaussian fields, we show that non-Gaussianity can enhance photon survival by several orders of magnitude relative to the Gaussian case, potentially explaining the unexpectedly VHE photon event observed by LHAASO.

We first model the broadband spectral energy distribution to determine the ionising continuum and then perform self-consistent photoionisation modelling of the RGS spectra. The stacked RGS spectrum requires three photoionised absorbers with time-averaged log xi approx 3.63, 3.10, and 2.01 and outflow velocities |v_out| approx 5820, 3210, and 2140 km/s. Their properties are broadly consistent with the three-phase obscurer reported in the 2009 intermediate state, indicating recurring multi-phase obscuration over decade timescales. Using five consecutive RGS observations, we track the wind evolution on day timescales and find strong variability in column density and ionisation in all phases, together with smaller but coherent changes in outflow velocity. During a flare, the low-ionisation phase shows an extreme drop in N_H, and the subsequent epoch exhibits an increase in outflow velocity in all phases, consistent with rapid restructuring and possible radiative acceleration in a clumpy wind. The high-ionisation phase responds most directly to changes in the ionising luminosity, while the lowest-ionisation phase shows at most a delayed response. Order-of-magnitude constraints place the obscurer at BLR scales (approx 10^3-10^5 R_g), and simple continuity arguments suggest kinetic power that can reach the percent level of L_bol for plausible estimates of geometry and clumpiness."}

With the completion of a new gamma-ray cycle, we aim to revisit the periodicity in Fermi-LAT data, and analyze all available multi-wavelength (MWL) data to search for possible correlations and time-lags. These observations will be used to test for the compatibility of the observed periodicity with a precessing jet from the supermassive black hole. We analyze data from Fermi-LAT, NuSTAR, Swift, AstroSat, ASAS-SN, ZTF, Pan-STARRS, and NEOWISE. In addition we present an analysis from historical observations from Palomar and Pulkovo. Single-band spectral variability, MWL correlations, and cross-correlations are computed. We then model the Fermi-LAT light curve with a precessing jet model, providing constraints on the geometry of the system and providing the evolution of the Doppler factor with time. The latter is used as input for MWL fitting of the spectral energy distribution. We confirm previous claims on the existence of a periodic gamma-ray signal. We detect significant spectral variability in gamma-ray, X-rays, and optical/UV data. We detect significant correlation between low-energy (infrared/optical/ultraviolet) data and gamma-rays, with a correlation index of about 1; the correlation between X-rays and gamma-ray is milder, with a correlation index of about 0.3. We do not detect any significant time-lag between bands. The Fermi-LAT light curve is successfully fit by a precessing jet model. The fit to the spectral energy distributions indicate that S5 1044+71 is a typical blazar, in which the gamma-ray emission is located beyond the broad-line region. All MWL observations we present in this work are consistent with the existence of a precessing relativistic jet from the supermassive black hole."}
