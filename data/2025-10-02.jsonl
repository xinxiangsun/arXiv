Only a handful of\nevents have been discovered to date, all through multi-wavelength (gamma ray)\nand multi-messenger (gravitational wave) signals. Given their scarcity, it is\nimportant to maximise the discovery possibility of new kilonova events. To this\nend, we present our follow-up observations of the gravitational-wave signal,\nS250818k, a plausible binary neutron star merger at a distance of $237 \\pm 62$\nMpc. Pan-STARRS tiled 286 and 318 square degrees (32% and 34% of the 90% sky\nlocalisation region) within 3 and 7 days of the GW signal, respectively. ATLAS\ncovered 70% of the skymap within 3 days, but with lower sensitivity. These\nobservations uncovered 47 new transients; however, none were deemed to be\nlinked to S250818k. We undertook an expansive follow-up campaign of AT 2025ulz,\nthe purported counterpart to S250818k. The griz-band lightcurve, combined with\nour redshift measurement ($z = 0.0849 \\pm 0.0003$) all indicate that SN 2025ulz\nis a SN IIb, and thus not the counterpart to S250818k.

At a redshift of $z = 0.409$ and magnified by a\nfactor of $\\sim$68, extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations have\nbeen obtained. The explosion mechanism producing this rare event and\ndifferences compared to lower redshift supernovae however have not been\nexplored in detail. Here we compare observations of iPTF16geu to existing\nradiative transfer simulations of type Ia supernova explosion models selected\nfrom the literature. We find that overall the DDC6 and PDDEL1 models, specific\nvariations of the delayed detonation explosion scenario, produce the closest\nmatch to the light curves and many absorption features, but struggle to\nreplicate the observed colours and in particular the rest-frame UV. We also\ninvestigate the magnification and reddening values required to improve\nagreement with the selected models. We find some evidence in favour of a UV\nflux excess that may be intrinsic to iPTF16geu or due to external factors such\nas host galaxy subtraction and uncertainties in the reddening law.
