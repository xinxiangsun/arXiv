Abstract: Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGN) feature order-of-magnitude variability in both the continuum and broad line luminosities on months-to-years long timescales, and are currently unexplained. Simulations have demonstrated that rotating black holes sometimes tear apart tilted accretion disks. These tearing events violently restructure the disk on timescales much shorter than a viscous timescale, hinting at a connection to CLAGN. Here, we show that disk tearing can power changing-look events. We report synthetic observations of an extremely high resolution three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thin, tilted accretion disk around a rapidly rotating, $10^8\,M_\odot$ black hole. We perform ray-tracing calculations that follow the disk light to both a line of sight camera and to a distribution of cameras in a prescribed torus-like broad line region. The continuum photoionizes the broad line region and we calculate the resulting spectrum. Both the continuum and line luminosities undergo order of magnitude swings on months-to-years long timescales. We find shorter, weeks long variability driven by the geometric precession of the inner disk and an intraday quasi-periodic oscillation driven by radial breathing of the inner disk. When the torn disk precesses, it causes asymmetric illumination of the broad line region, driving time-evolving red-to-blue asymmetries of the broad emission lines that may be a smoking gun for disk tearing. We also make predictions for future photometric observations from ULTRASAT and Vera Rubin Observatory, both of which may play an important role in detecting future changing-look events.

TL;DR: 对ASKAP巡天数据的10秒分辨率搜索未发现长周期射电暂现源，但识别出6颗恒星的耀发，并给出了暂现源表面密度的下限限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长周期射电暂现源(LPTs)是近期发现的现象，其周期在分钟到小时量级，填补了现有射电暂现源搜索技术的时间尺度空白。为增加已知LPTs样本，需要专门搜索。

Method: 使用ASKAP巡天项目的200小时存档数据，在750平方度天区以10秒时间分辨率进行成像搜索，这是首次在秒级分辨率下的大规模ASKAP数据搜索。

Result: 未探测到LPTs，但识别出6颗恒星的射电耀发，其中至少一颗是首次在射电波段探测到。给出了10秒时间尺度下暂现源表面密度的下限：2.21×10^-6 deg^-2，灵敏度为16.9 mJy。

Conclusion: 评估了使用ASKAP进行10秒成像探测射电暂现源的可行性，为改进LPTs探测流程和观测策略提供了见解。

Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a recently identified phenomenon that challenge our current understanding of compact objects and coherent radio emission mechanisms. These objects emit radio pulses similar to those of pulsars, but at much longer periods -- on the order of minutes to hours. With duty cycles of only a few percent, individual pulses have been observed to last between 10 and 1000 seconds. This places LPTs in a timescale gap between the two main techniques used in transient radio searches: time-series analysis at millisecond to second timescales, and image-plane searches sensitive to variability on the scale of days. As a result, LPTs remained undetected until recently, and only a handful are currently known. To increase the sample of known LPTs, we conducted a dedicated search using 200 hours of archival data from the ASKAP Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey, covering 750 deg$^2$ of sky at the shortest possible imaging time step of 10-seconds. This represents the first large-scale search using ASKAP data at second-scale resolution. Although no LPTs were detected, we identified flares from six stars, at least one had never been detected in the radio regime before. We placed a lower limit on the transient surface density of $2.21\times10^{-6}$ deg$^{-2}$ at a 10-second timescale, with a sensitivity of 16.9 mJy. Our findings evaluate the feasibility of detecting radio transients using 10-second imaging with ASKAP and provide insights into improving detection pipelines and observation strategies for LPTs.

Motivation: 开发真实的边界模型来预测银河系中微子和伽马射线发射，并与现有观测数据进行比较验证。

Method: 使用GALPROP宇宙射线传播框架开发一系列真实的边界模型，预测中微子和伽马射线信号，并与IceCube和LHAASO的PeV能量数据进行比较。

Result: 所有GALPROP模型在不确定性范围内都与中微子数据一致，在考虑可能的伽马射线点源污染后，也与LHAASO数据推导的中微子发射预期一致。

Conclusion: 新模型为银河系甚高能中微子发射提供了最先进的预测，可用于未来的中微子搜索。

Abstract: We use the GALPROP cosmic ray (CR) propagation framework to model the diffuse neutrino and gamma-ray emissions from the Galaxy. A collection of realistic bounding models are developed and predictions of the resulting neutrino and gamma-ray signals are compared to the IceCube and LHAASO data up to PeV energies. We find that all the GALPROP models are consistent with the neutrino data within uncertainties. They are also consistent with expectations of neutrino emissions derived from LHAASO data when accounting for possible gamma-ray point source contamination. The new models present state-of-the-art predictions for the VHE neutrino emissions from the Galaxy that may be used for future neutrino searches.

### [4] [A precessing magnetic jet as the engine of GRB 250702B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09850)
*Tao An*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: GRB 250702B表现出超长、间歇性的瞬时活动，在约3.2小时内出现三个硬伽马射线爆发，间隔约2825秒，且前一天有软X射线耀斑。该研究提出统一模型，认为恒星质量黑洞从大质量、不对准的碎片盘中吸积，并发射磁主导、进动、结构化（脊柱-鞘层）喷流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释GRB 250702B的异常辐射和流出特征，包括其超长持续时间、周期性爆发模式以及光谱特性，这些现象难以用标准伽马射线暴模型解释。

Method: 采用统一场景模型，其中黑洞从不对准的碎片盘吸积，产生磁主导的进动结构化喷流。发动机时钟来自内环外部的Lense-Thirring进动，硬光谱反映脊柱中的磁重联耗散。

Result: 模型成功解释了GRB 250702B的观测特征：周期性爆发、缺失脉冲（由低幅度章动导致）、硬光谱特性，并解决了视开放角张力问题。

Conclusion: 该模型为GRB 250702B的辐射和流出异常提供了自洽解释，并给出了可检验的具体预测，支持磁主导进动喷流作为此类超长伽马射线暴的可行机制。

Abstract: GRB 250702B shows ultra long, episodic prompt activity, with three hard gamma ray episodes over about 3.2 h with quasi regular spacing P ~ 2825 s, preceded by a soft X ray flare about one day earlier. We interpret these phenomena with a unified scenario in which a stellar mass black hole accretes from a massive, misaligned debris disk and launches a magnetically dominated, precessing, structured (spine sheath) jet. The engine clock arises from Lense Thirring precession of the outer annulus of a geometrically thick inner torus at radius r ~ 250 to 300 gravitational radii, while the hard spectra reflect magnetic reconnection dissipation in the spine. A slightly off axis viewing geometry resolves the apparent opening angle tension without invoking late energy injection. "Missing" pulses in the second and third cycles occur naturally when low amplitude nutation causes the beaming cone to miss the line of sight. The model yields concrete, falsifiable predictions, providing a self consistent explanation of GRB 250702B radiative and outflow anomalies.

Motivation: 研究超亮X射线源NGC 470 HLX1的光谱特性，探索这些源是否由吸积中子星驱动，并理解其粒子加速机制。

Method: 对NGC 470 HLX1进行宽带光谱分析，建立同步辐射模型，研究磁化中子星不同纬度的辐射变化，分析超爱丁顿吸积条件下的粒子加速过程。

Result: 检测到类黑体成分，表明在共转半径附近存在吸积盘或从盘中喷出的外流；同步辐射模型在HLX系统中具有可行性。

Conclusion: 超亮X射线源可能由吸积中子星驱动，同步辐射机制为理解这些源的性质提供了新视角，需要进一步样本研究来验证这一假设。

Abstract: We present the first broadband spectral analysis of NGC 470 HLX1, a hyperluminous X-ray source that exhibits significant flux variability over different epochs. We investigate the feasibility of synchrotron radiation with varying latitude from a magnetized neutron star to explain the source's spectra. We also shed light on the particle acceleration mechanisms and maximum Lorentz factor of electrons within the neutron star magnetospheric plasma under super-Eddington accretion conditions. In our broadband spectral modeling, the detection of a blackbody-like component suggests the presence of a disk near the corotation radius or an outflow ejected from the disk. The viability of synchrotron emission in an HLX system offers new insights about the nature of these sources, motivating further sample studies to assess whether most of these sources are powered by accreting neutron stars.

Conclusion: 这项工作为研究星系中心区域开辟了新途径，可以通过引力波分析恢复盘面气体密度分布ρ(r)

Abstract: Massive black holes surrounded by a gaseous disk have been a prevailing model to explain a wide spectrum of astrophysical phenomena related to active galactic nucle (AGNs). However, direct and precise measurements of the disk density profiles remain elusive for current telescopes. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to pinpoint the gas density if an inspiralling stellar mass binary black hole is embedded in the AGN disk. Furthermore, if the barycenter of the pair follows an eccentric orbit around an AGN, then space-borne gravitational wave detectors can measure the density of the surrounding disk with multi-year observations by tracking the gravitational wave evolution. The error between the inferred density profile and the injected truth can be constrained to below $2\times10^{-11}\rm g/cm^3$. Our work opens up an exciting new channel to investigate the very center of galaxies, where disk gas density distributions $ρ(r)$ can be recovered by analyzing time-dependent environmental imprints in gravitational waveforms.

Motivation: 研究CGRaBS J0211+1051的发射机制，特别是其X射线谱异常柔软的特征，以及光学活动与伽马射线变化的不一致性，旨在理解该BL Lac天体中的粒子加速和辐射过程。

Method: 收集超过十年的多波段观测数据，分析2011年1月和2019年6月两次主要伽马射线耀斑期间的时间特性和光谱特性。使用纯轻子模型和强子-轻子混合模型拟合四个不同时期的宽带SED。

Result: 强子-轻子模型比纯轻子模型能更好地解释观测到的SED，特别是在考虑陡峭的光学-UV谱时。该模型表明CGRaBS J0211+1051可能是潜在的中微子发射体和TeV亮源。

Conclusion: CGRaBS J0211+1051的强子-轻子解释为检验耀变体喷流中强子-轻子对多信使发射的贡献提供了独特的测试平台。

Abstract: We present an extensive analysis of the multi-wavelength data of the low-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac object CGRaBS J0211+1051, which has been gathered over more than ten years with many observatories. Two major gamma-ray flares have been observed during the Fermi era: one in January 2011 and other in June 2019. During these events, CGRaBS J0211+1051 was also bright in other energy bands. On the other hand, there are also examples of optical activity that do not exhibit any comparable gamma-ray variability. Here, we study the temporal and spectral characteristics of the object in an attempt to understand the emission mechanisms operating in this source. A peculiar feature in its spectrum is the X-ray domain, which is unusually soft considering its object class. Interestingly, the relatively soft UV and optical spectrum does not extrapolate well to the X-rays. To mimic the observed SEDs during quiescent and flaring periods, we use both a purely leptonic and a hadro-leptonic modeling approach to reproduce four broadband SEDs from various epochs. When taking into account the steep optical-UV spectrum, we find that the hadro-leptonic scenarios better explains the SEDs compared to the purely leptonic model. The hadro-leptonic interpretation of the two gamma-ray flares suggests that CGRaBS J0211+1051 could be both a potential neutrino emitter and TeV-bright (E>10 TeV). Thus, it may offer a unique test bed to check for hadro-leptonic contributions to the multi-messenger emission in blazar jets.

Conclusion: 这项研究证明了未来气球任务（如POEMMA-Balloon）从近空间环境进行目标机会后续观测的可行性。

Abstract: The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) mission launched from Wanaka New Zealand on May 13, 2023. The mission ended after 36 h due to a balloon leak that resulted in the payload being lost in the Pacific Ocean. Over the course of the mission, the onboard Cherenkov Telescope (CT) was pointed just below the Earth's limb to search for optical signals from upward-moving extensive air showers that were induced by decaying tau-leptons that were generated by the conversion of $>10$ PeV tau-neutrinos in Earth. Such very-high energy (VHE) neutrinos may be produced in several classes of astrophysical sources that are suspected of possibly accelerating particles to ultra-high energies. In this contribution, we discuss the EUSO-SPB2 Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) campaign to search for VHE neutrino signals coming from astrophysical sources that crossed the CT's field of view ($6.4^\circ \times 12.8^\circ$). We also present a new software tool designed for scheduling observations, the Neutrino Target Scheduler, that we developed to support the ToO campaign. We also calculate upper limits on the neutrino fluences from sources observed during the ToO campaign. Our observations demonstrate the viability of conducting ToO follow-up observations from a near space environment with future balloon missions, such as the pathfinder mission POEMMA-Balloon with Radio.

Motivation: 目前对X射线双星中宽带噪声成分的存在与否以及准周期振荡的产生机制尚无共识，许多研究者认为准周期振荡是由Lense-Thirring力矩引起的参考系拖曳效应导致的。

Method: 通过分析估计来评估状态转变期间内吸积盘中是否存在几何翘曲，并研究翘曲如何影响光谱-时间特性。

Result: 研究表明翘曲的存在可以以与爆发期间观测到的准周期振荡类型转变相匹配的方式改变光谱-时间特性，并为状态转变期间宽带噪声和准周期振荡特性的演化提供一致解释。

Conclusion: 翘曲的出现为黑洞X射线双星状态转变期间的变异性演化提供了统一解释，为统一黑洞X射线双星的变异性提供了第一条路径。

Abstract: X-ray binaries exhibit complex variability patterns studied in the power-spectrum. These include the broad-band noise (BBN) components and various types of narrow components called quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). There is currently no consensus about either what determines the presence/absence of the BBN or what generates the QPOs. Many believe the latter is due to frame-dragging effects caused by Lense-Thirring torques. We wish to investigate the potential impact of those frame-dragging effects on the accretion disk itself. In particular, we focus on its impact on the observed variability and the presence (and types) of QPOs associated. We make analytical estimates to assess the potential presence of a geometric warp in the inner accretion disk during state transitions. We show that the presence of a warp can modify the spectral-timing properties in a way that matches the observed transition between QPO types during outbursts. We also discuss the peculiar case of Cyg X-1, as well as how the hard-to-soft transition could be driven by the warp itself. The (expected) emergence of a warp provides a consistent explanation for the evolution of both the BBN and the QPO properties during state transitions. This offers a first path toward unifying the variability of black hole X-ray binary.

Motivation: 通过射电观测探测相对论性夏皮罗延迟效应，以更精确地测量毫秒脉冲星PSR J1231-1411的质量，这对理解中子星内部状态方程具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 虽然质量约束相对较弱，但轨道倾角测量结果已为NICER X射线研究提供了重要信息，从该困难脉冲星研究中获得的经验将有助于未来高精度质量测量活动和对中子星内部状态方程的约束。

Abstract: We present 15 years of Nançay and Green Bank radio telescope timing observations for PSR J1231$-$1411. This millisecond pulsar is a primary science target for the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer telescope (NICER, which discovered its X-ray pulsations), has accumulated near-continuous $γ$-ray data since the Fermi-Large Area Telescope's launch, and has been studied extensively with the Green Bank and Nançay radio telescopes. We have undertaken a campaign with the Green Bank Telescope targeting specific orbital phases designed to improve our constraint on the pulsar's mass through the detection of a relativistic Shapiro delay. Both frequentist and Bayesian techniques -- the latter incorporating priors from white dwarf binary evolution models -- are applied to fifteen years of radio observations, yielding relatively weak constraints on the companion and pulsar masses of $0.23^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $1.87^{+1.11}_{-0.67}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively (68.3% CI from Bayesian fits); however, the orbital inclination is measured to better relative precision ($79.80^{+3.47}_{-4.70}$ degrees). Restricting the maximum allowed pulsar mass to 3 M$_{\odot}$ while simultaneously sampling the noise and timing models improves the constraint and lowers the measured mass to $1.62^{+0.73}_{-0.58}$ M$_{\odot}$. While our radio-derived inclination result has informed recent NICER X-ray studies of PSR J1231$-$1411, the lessons learned from this troublesome pulsar will also bolster future high-precision mass measurement campaigns and resulting constraints on the neutron star interior equation of state.

Motivation: 研究V4641 Sgr作为微类星体，解释其在PeV能量宇宙线通量中的潜在作用，特别是其伽马射线辐射特性。

Method: 使用约100小时的H.E.S.S.数据，结合HI和CO观测，进行光谱形态学研究，分析伽马射线辐射区域和目标物质分布。

Result: 检测到多TeV辐射，区域呈拉长形态，能谱指数约1.8，SED峰值在约100 TeV。发现可能的两组分形态（3σ），未发现稠密气体靶。

Conclusion: 观测结果更支持伽马射线辐射的轻子起源，但不排除V4641 Sgr系统中存在强子加速过程。

Abstract: Microquasars have emerged as promising candidates to explain the cosmic-ray flux at petaelectronvolt energies. LHAASO observations revealed V4641~Sgr as the most extreme example so far. Using $\approx$100~h of H.E.S.S. data, we performed a spectro-morphological study of the gamma-ray emission around V4641~Sgr. We employed HI and dedicated CO observations of the region to infer the target material for cosmic-ray interactions. We detected multi-TeV emission around V4641~Sgr with a high significance. The emission region is elongated. We found a power-law spectrum with an index $\approx$1.8, and together with results from other gamma-ray instruments, this reveals a spectral energy distribution that peaks at energies of $\approx$100~TeV for the first time. We found indications (3$σ$) of a two-component morphology, with indistinguishable spectral properties. The position of V4641~Sgr is inconsistent with the best-fit position of the single-component model and with the dip between the two components. We found no significant evidence of an energy-dependent morphology. No dense gas was found at any distance towards V4641~Sgr. The peak of the SED at $\approx$100~TeV identifies V4641~Sgr as a candidate cosmic-ray accelerator beyond the so-called knee. The absence of dense target gas places stringent energetic constraints on hadronic interpretations, however. The H.E.S.S. measurement requires an unusually hard ($\approx 1.5$) spectral index for the protons. A leptonic scenario faces fewer obstacles if the particle transport is fast enough to avoid losses and to reproduce the observed energy-independent morphology. The absence of bright \xray emission across the gamma-ray emission region requires a magnetic field strength $\lesssim3$~$μ$G, however. Our findings favour a leptonic origin of the gamma-ray emission. This conclusion does not exclude hadron acceleration in the V4641~Sgr system.

Result: 约束了最大河外磁场强度为10^-14 G，提供了伽马射线和中微子通量上限，估计了单个源的UHECR光度，并预测了切伦科夫望远镜阵列对NGC 1068的探测能力。

Conclusion: 结合伽马射线、中微子和UHECR观测的多信使方法对于理解高能天体物理源的性质和宇宙射线加速机制至关重要。

Abstract: The detection of high-energy astrophysical multimessengers establishes a connection between ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and powerful cosmic accelerators. Interactions of UHECRs with radiation fields and interstellar matter generate very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays and neutrinos, making them key components in the multimessenger framework. This study examines the cosmogenic gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes resulting from UHECR propagation in starburst galaxies with supernova remnants, with a particular focus on NGC 1068, a well-established high-energy neutrino source. Using extragalactic simulations, we calculate the upper limit on cosmic-ray luminosity, applying upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes derived from observations by H.E.S.S. and MAGIC observatories. Our analysis incorporates the effects of both extragalactic and galactic magnetic fields on particle propagation, constraining the maximum extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF) intensity to $10^{-14}~\mathrm{G}$ to ensure that at least 90\% of injected UHECRs successfully reach Earth. The results provide upper limits on gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes, estimates of UHECR luminosity for individual sources, and predictions for the detection capabilities of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory regarding gamma-ray emission from NGC 1068. Combining gamma-ray, neutrino, and UHECR observations reinforces the importance of multimessenger approaches in understanding the nature of high-energy astrophysical sources and their role in cosmic-ray acceleration.

TL;DR: 提出使用自编码器(AE)的潜在空间参数替代传统经验参数，用于TAIGA实验的广延大气簇射(EAS)分析，实现多模态数据融合和初级粒子能量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TAIGA实验包含不同类型的切伦科夫探测器，由于信号物理性质不同，直接合并数据不可行。传统方法使用经验选择的辅助参数，无法保证保留所有重要信息。

Method: 使用自编码器从实验数据中提取潜在空间参数，然后用单独的神经网络从潜在空间重建EAS初级粒子参数。基于TAIGA-HiSCORE的蒙特卡洛模拟数据进行能量重建。

Conclusion: AE潜在空间参数能够保留实验数据中的基本物理信息，无需先验假设，为异构IACT和HiSCORE数据的无缝集成提供了潜力。

Abstract: The aim of extensive air shower (EAS) analysis is to reconstruct the physical parameters of the primary particle that initiated the shower. The TAIGA experiment is a hybrid detector system that combines several imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and an array of non-imaging Cherenkov detectors (TAIGA-HiSCORE) for EAS detection. Because the signals recorded by different detector types differ in physical nature, the direct merging of data is unfeasible, which complicates multimodal analysis. Currently, to analyze data from the IACTs and TAIGA-HiSCORE, a set of auxiliary parameters specific to each detector type is calculated from the recorded signals. These parameters are chosen empirically, so there is no certainty that they retain all important information and are the best suited for the respective problems. We propose to use autoencoders (AE) for the analysis of TAIGA experimental data and replace the conventionally used auxiliary parameters with the parameters of the AE latent space. The advantage of the AE latent space parameters is that they preserve essential physics from experimental data without prior assumptions. This approach also holds potential for enabling seamless integration of heterogeneous IACT and HiSCORE data through a joint latent space. To reconstruct the parameters of the primary particle of the EAS from the latent space of the AE, a separate artificial neural network is used. In this paper, the proposed approach is used to reconstruct the energy of the EAS primary particles based on Monte Carlo simulation data for TAIGA-HiSCORE. The dependence of the energy determination accuracy on the dimensionality of the latent space is analyzed, and these results are also compared with the results obtained by the conventional technique. It is shown that when using the AE latent space, the energy of the primary particle is reconstructed with satisfactory accuracy.

CPISM's modular design allows flexibility, accommodating different stellar and planetary models, and can simulate instrumental noise, cosmic rays, and other observational effects. This tool aids in data processing, signal-to-noise ratio analysis, and high-contrast photometry, contributing to future exoplanet discovery and characterization efforts. The program's outputs will enhance observation planning and scientific return for the CPI-C mission, providing critical insights into exoplanetary systems.

Abstract: POLAR-2 is a next-generation space astronomy platform led by China, with its core scientific objective focused on high-precision polarization measurements of gamma-ray bursts. As one of its key payloads, the Low-energy Polarization Detector (LPD) is designed to perform wide-field surveys to capture X-ray polarization information from gamma-ray bursts in the 2-10 keV energy range. This paper presents Topmetal-L, a dedicated charge-sensitive pixel sensor developed for the LPD prototype upgrade. Fabricated in a 130 nm CMOS process in 2024, the chip integrates a 356 $\times$ 512 pixel array with a pixel pitch of 45 $μ$m. Each pixel incorporates a 26 $\times$ 26 $μ$m^2 charge-collecting electrode window and is capable of simultaneously outputting both energy and position information of deposited charges. Topmetal-L has been systematically optimized for power consumption, noise performance, and readout efficiency. It exhibits an input dynamic range of 0-4 ke-, a typical charge-to-voltage conversion gain of 76.04 $μ$V/e-, an average equivalent noise charge of approximately 22.8 e-, a sensitive area exceeding 3.6 cm^2, and a total power consumption of 720 mW per chip. To meet the requirements of large-area, high-frame-rate readout for gas-based polarization detectors, a sentinel-scanning readout scheme is proposed, reducing the full-frame readout time to 730 $μ$s. A prototype Topmetal-L-based gas polarization detection system was evaluated across key energies: it exhibited a residual modulation of 0.26% $\pm$ 0.45% at 5.90 keV, a modulation factor of 66.67% $\pm$ 0.45% for a linearly polarized 8.0 keV source, and a counting rate saturated at 15 k counts/(cm^2$\cdot$s) when tested at 5.4 keV.

Abstract: Accurate null depth retrieval is critical in nulling interferometry. However, achieving accurate null depth calibration is challenging due to various noise sources, instrumental imperfections, and the complexity of real observational environments. These challenges necessitate advanced calibration techniques that can efficiently handle such uncertainties while maintaining a high accuracy. This paper aims to incorporate machine-learning techniques with a Bayesian inference to improve the accuracy and efficiency of null depth retrieval in nulling interferometry. Specifically, it explores the use of neural posterior estimation (NPE) to develop models that overcome the computational limitations of conventional methods, such as numerical self-calibration (NSC), providing a more robust solution for accurate null depth calibration. An NPE-based model was developed, with a simulator that incorporates real data to better represent specific conditions. The model was tested on both synthetic and observational data from the LBTI nuller for evaluation. The NPE model successfully demonstrated improved efficiency, achieving results comparable to current methods in use. It achieved a null depth retrieval accuracy down to a few $10^{-4}$ on real observational data, matching the performance of conventional approaches while offering significant computational advantages, reducing the data retrieval time to one-quarter of the time required by self-calibration methods. The NPE model presents a practical and scalable solution for null depth calibration in nulling interferometry, offering substantial improvements in efficiency over existing methods with a better precision and application to other interferometric techniques.
