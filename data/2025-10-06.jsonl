Collaboration", "summary": "Multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astrophysics have experienced rapid\ngrowth over the past decade, seeking a complete picture of different cosmic\nphenomena. Transient sources, in particular, benefit from the input of\nmulti-messenger observations, offering complementary perspectives on the same\nevent while maximizing the detection probability of a rapidly fading signal. In\nthis context, Gravitational Wave (GW) detections serve as perfect triggers for\npotential counterpart detections. Notably, a GW alert could be associated with\na Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), jetted cataclysmic events produced either by the\ncollision of a binary neutron star system or a core-collapse supernova. These\nsources also radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing detection by\nX- and gamma-ray instruments aboard various satellites and thus enabling\nmulti-wavelength triggering opportunities. The strong interest in minimizing\nreaction time to capture the full-time evolution of the emission, together with\nthe often challenging localization uncertainties of the alerts, underscores the\nneed for rapid and well-coordinated follow-up programs such as the one\ndeveloped by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration.\n  This contribution will give an overview of the transient follow-up strategy\ncarried out by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration, from the external alert trigger and\nthe automatic reaction of the observatory to the various analysis steps of the\nobtained observations. To illustrate this comprehensive strategy, we will show\ntwo examples of follow-up observations of both GRBs and GWs, highlighting key\nresults and challenges in the search for an associated high-energy gamma-ray\nemission."}

However, with the X-ray SPECtroscopy and Timing\n(XSPECT) payload on-board Indias first X-ray Polarimetry Satellite (XPoSat), we\nhave the capability to study the source despite its very high brightness,\nthanks to the fast (1 ms) readout of the instrument. We investigate the\nevolution of the spectral and timing properties of Sco X-1 across the\nhorizontal, normal, and flaring branch, as observed with XSPECT. We examine\nchanges in the spectral parameters as a function of position on the color-color\ndiagram (CCD). Spectral studies indicate that the soft X-ray emission can be\nmodeled using a multicolor disk component, with the inner disk temperature\nranging from 0.6 to 0.8 keV. The hard component is described by a Comptonized\ncontinuum using either the nthComp or Comptb model with electron temperatures\nfrom 2.4 to 4.7 keV and optical depth between 5 and 14. Additionally, we\nobserve the presence of an iron K-alpha line at 6.6 keV and an iron K-beta line\nat 7.6 keV. Both spectral models suggest a steep rise in Comptonization flux as\nwell as disk flux in the flaring branch. An increase in neutron star blackbody\ntemperature and inner disk temperature are also observed during flaring. The\nZ-track is driven by changes in the optical depth of the corona, the\nComptonization flux and the disk flux and the inner disk temperature. No\nquasi-periodic oscillations are detected in any branch, suggesting their\nassociation with the high-energy spectrum."}

The resulting output intensity pattern encodes pupil phase\ninformation, enabling wavefront recovery via a neural network.

Exploring the full power of\nhigh-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of gamma Cas stars requires comparison of\nobservations of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines near 6.4 keV with\nsynthetic profiles of this line complex computed in the framework of the\nmagnetic interaction and the accreting WD scenarios. For the latter, we further\ndistinguish between accretion onto a non-magnetic and a magnetic WD. Our models\naccount for different reservoirs of reprocessing material: the Be circumstellar\ndecretion disk, the Be photosphere, an accretion disk around the WD companion,\na magnetically channelled accretion flow and the WD photosphere. We find\nconsiderably different line properties for the different scenarios. For a\nnon-magnetic accreting WD, the global Fe Kalpha complex is extremely broad,\nreaching a full width of 140 eV, whilst it is ~ 40 eV for the magnetic\nstar-disk interaction and the magnetic accreting WD cases. In the magnetic\nstar-disk interaction, the line centroid follows the orbital motion of the Be\nstar, whereas it moves along with the WD in the case of an accreting WD. For\ngamma Cas, given the 15 times larger amplitude of the WD orbital motion, the\nshift in position for an accreting WD should be easily detectable with\nhigh-resolution spectrographs such as Resolve on XRISM, but remains essentially\nundetectable for the magnetic star-disk interaction. Upcoming high-resolution\nspectroscopy of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines in the X-ray spectra\nof gamma Cas stars will thus allow to distinguish between the competing\nscenarios."}

Recently, several PTAs have found evidence\nfor the presence of GWs in their datasets, but none of them have achieved a\ncommunity-defined definitive (> 5$\\sigma$) detection. Here, we identify\nlimiting noise sources for PTAs and quantify their impact on sensitivity to GWs\nunder different observing and noise modelling strategies. First, we search for\nintrinsic pulse jitter in a sample of 89 MSPs observed by the MeerKAT Pulsar\nTiming Array and obtain new jitter measurements for 20 MSPs. We then forecast\njitter noise in pulsars for the future SKA-Mid telescope, finding that the\ntiming precision of many of the best-timed MSPs would be dominated by jitter\nnoise. We then consider dispersion measure variations from the interstellar\nmedium and find that their effects are best mitigated by modelling them as a\nstationary Gaussian process with a power-law spectrum. Improving upon the\nestablished hasasia code for PTA sensitivity analysis, we assess the timing\npotential of the lower frequency UHF-band (544$-$1088\\,MHz) of MeerKAT and find\na potential increase in GW background sensitivity by $\\approx 8$\\%, relative to\nobserving at L-band. We show that this improvement relies on assumptions on the\npropagation through the interstellar medium, and highlight that if observing\nfrequency-dependent propagation effects, such as scattering noise, are present,\nwhere noise is not completely correlated across observing frequency, then the\nimprovement is significantly diminished. Using the multi-frequency receivers\nand sub-arraying flexibility of MeerKAT, we find that focussed, high-cadence\nobservations of the best MSPs can enhance the sensitivity of the array for both\nthe continuous GWs and stochastic GWB.

All three cold fronts are likely\nto be parts of an enormous swirling pattern, rooted in the core.

This outermost cold front has probably survived for $2-3$ Gyr since the\ndisturbance. We identified single sharp edges in the surface brightness\nprofiles of the southern and southwestern sections of the cold front, whereas\nthe western section is better characterized with double edges. This implies\nthat magnetic fields have preserved the leading edge of the cold front, while\nits western side is beginning to split into two cold fronts likely due to\nKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The slopes of the 2D power spectrum of the\nX-ray surface brightness fluctuations, derived for the brighter side of the\ncold front, are consistent with the expectation from Kolmogorov turbulence.
