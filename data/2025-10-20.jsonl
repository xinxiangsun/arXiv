Traditional deterministic\ncataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed\nproblem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational\ninefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband\ncoadded images, the primary output format for LSST images.

While the earlier studies of such wave-mediated BLs typically\nmodeled the internal structure of the central object as a globally isothermal\nsphere with sharply rising density profile, here we explore the effect of other\ninternal density and temperature profiles on the mode operation. We model the\ninner structure of an accretor as a polytropic sphere, allowing a shallower\nincrease of density and a non-trivial temperature profile inside the object.\nWhile the mix of acoustic modes observed in our long-duration (1000 inner\norbits long) 2D hydrodynamic simulations is a weak function of the polytropic\nindex $n$ of the accretor's structure, the mass accretion rate and the angular\nmomentum flux across the BL show a clear dependence on $n$, both decreasing in\namplitude as $n$ is lowered.

We\ndiscuss the implications of this finding in the context of blazar spectral\nenergy distributions, particularly the potential existence of a third SED bump\nin the kiloelectronvolt to megaelectronvolt range. The observed spectral\nfeatures support the hypothesis that 1ES 0229+200 could be a source of\nhigh-energy neutrino emission."}

Accepted for publication in PASJ", "summary": "We report our near-infrared (NIR) follow-up observations of the gravitational\nwave (GW) event S240422ed using the Subaru Telescope/MOIRCS. S240422ed was\ninitially classified as a black hole-neutron star merger with $>$ 99%\nprobability of electromagnetic wave emission. We started follow-up observations\n7.8 hours after the event. Over two nights, we observed 206 nearby galaxies in\n$Y$ and $K_{\\rm s}$ bands down to about 21.4 and 21.1 AB mag (3$\\sigma$),\nrespectively. The total completeness of our survey based on galaxy $B$-band\nluminosity is 22%. As a result of our observations, five candidate counterparts\nwere identified. We show that properties of these five objects are not\nconsistent with kilonova such as AT2017gfo. Four objects are consistent with\nknown classes of transients such as supernovae or dwarf nova outbursts. On the\nother hand, the nature of the remaining one object, which shows a red color and\nrapid decline, remains unclear. Although later analyses of GW signal\nreclassified S240422ed as likely terrestrial noise, our NIR observations\nprovide valuable lessons for future NIR surveys for GW sources. We demonstrate\nthat deep NIR follow-up observations as presented in this work would\neffectively constrain the presence of red kilonova even at 200 Mpc distance. We\nalso discuss the importance of deep and wide NIR reference images and of\nunderstanding the properties and frequency of Galactic transients."}

Aims: We aim to provide estimates for diffuse\n$\\gamma$-ray emission in the Fermi-LAT band from galaxy clusters and the cosmic\nweb in the local Universe. Methods: In this work we show results from the first\ncosmological MHD simulation with an on-the-fly spectral CR model. We model CR\ninjection at shocks, account for adiabatic energy changes and advection of CR\nprotons, and obtain their $\\gamma$-ray emissivity directly from the simulated\nCR energy density and spectra. For this we use constrained initial conditions,\nwhich evolve in a field closely resembling that of the local Universe, allowing\ndirect comparison to Fermi-LAT data on massive clusters. Results: We find CR\nproton acceleration at all structure formation and accretion shocks in galaxy\nclusters and cosmic web filaments. These protons provide the basis for diffuse\n$\\gamma$-ray emission in these regimes. The absolute value of the diffuse\n$\\gamma$-ray emission in our simulation lies a few orders of magnitude below\nthe current upper limits found by Fermi-LAT.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are the oldest but fastest pulsars known to date.\nTo explain how these pulsars could be formed, a new hypothesis was formulated:\nthe recycling of pulsars, i.e the fact that a pulsar could accrete matter from\na companion and been spun up. In this paper, we developed a population\nsynthesis algorithm for pulsars which belong to a binary, in order to check\nwhether most of the observed recycled pulsars were formed via an accretion\nmechanism and derive statistics about their properties, that are difficult to\nobtain through observations. We also make predictions for future surveys.\nToward the presented objectives, we use the code Stellar EVolution for N-body\n(SEVN) to take into account all the binary processes and our own code to evolve\neach pulsar self-consistently by taking into account the secular evolution of a\nforce-free magnetosphere, the magnetic field decay, gravitational braking and\nspatial evolution. Each pulsar is born in binary with a main sequence\ncompanion, and evolve to present time. The radio and $\\gamma$-ray emission\nlocations were modeled by the polar cap geometry and striped wind model,\nrespectively. Our simulations seem to reproduce well the population of radio\nand $\\gamma$-ray pulsars observed in the selected surveys. We also found that\nthere should be less than $330$ unidentified pulsars in the Fourth Fermi-LAT\ncatalogue of $\\gamma$-ray sources (4FGL). High values of the viewing angle\n$\\zeta$ seem to be needed to be able to observe the recycled pulsars, and it\nalso seems difficult to observe recycled pulsars with an aligned rotation axis\nand magnetic axis (i.e., $\\chi \\leq 10${\\deg}).

A successful example is the GECAM-HXMT-SVOM (GHS) constellation\ncollaboration, which sets a precedent for other gamma-ray monitor\nconstellations. However, joint duty also presents challenges to Burst Advocates\n(BAs), including the increased number of triggers and, more importantly, the\nfrequent switching between various systems due to incompatibilities among\ndifferent missions, which complicates the situation. To address the current\nrequirements of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astronomy, we developed a\ncustomized framework for unified trigger processing within the GHS joint duty,\nnamed \"BA's Rapid Evaluation and Analysis Kit for Formulating Alerts and\nSummary Tools\" (BREAKFAST). This framework incorporates a series of automated,\nsemi-automated, and manual pipelines designed to rapidly process triggers of\nprompt emissions in the gamma-ray band from different instruments, while\nmaintaining flexible compatibility for future missions. The pursuit of\nBREAKFAST goes beyond merely providing trigger processing for BAs. BREAKFAST\nalso aims to filtering high-value targets and guiding follow-up telescopes\nthrough rapid analysis and reporting, thus serving as an important bridge\nbetween prompt emission observations and afterglow observations. To this end, a\nsuite of comprehensive analysis modules is included in BREAKFAST, particularly\nthe specially designed module that predicts X-ray afterglow brightness based on\nprompt emission properties. The framework's effectiveness has already been\ndemonstrated in recent observational campaigns, and it is expected to play a\nsignificant role in the discovery and observation of peculiar transients in the\nfuture."}
