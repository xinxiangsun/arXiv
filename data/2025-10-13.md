TL;DR: 使用随机森林和极端梯度提升两种机器学习方法对Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4目录中的未关联伽马射线源进行分类，主要识别新的伽马射线脉冲星候选体。


<details>

Motivation: Fermi-LAT第四版目录中约33%的伽马射线源没有已知的低波段对应体，对这些未关联源进行适当分类对于种群研究和多波段观测至关重要。

Method: 采用随机森林和极端梯度提升两种监督机器学习技术，利用Fermi-LAT长期观测获得的观测特征对未关联源进行分类。

Result: 成功对4FGL-DR4目录中的未关联源进行了详细分类，主要识别了新的伽马射线脉冲星候选体。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能有效分类Fermi-LAT未关联伽马射线源，为多波段观测和种群研究提供重要支持。

Abstract: The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the \emph{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space
Telescope has been continuously providing good quality
  survey data of the entire sky in the high energy range from 30 MeV to 500 GeV
and above since August 2008. A succession of gamma-ray
  source catalogs is published after a comprehensive analysis of the
\emph{Fermi}--LAT data. The most recent release of data in the
  fourth \emph{Fermi}--LAT catalog of gamma-ray sources (4FGL-DR4), based on
the first 14 years of observations in the energy band
  50 MeV-1 TeV, contains 7195 sources. A large fraction ($\sim$ 33\%) of this
population has no known counterparts in the lower wave
  bands. Such high energy gamma-ray sources are referred to as unassociated or
unidentified. An appropriate classification of these
  objects into known type of gamma-ray sources such as the active galactic
nuclei or pulsars is essential for population studies and
  pointed multi-wavelength observations to probe the radiative processes. In
this work, we perform a detailed classification of the
  unassociated sources reported in the 4FGL-DR4 catalog using two supervised
machine learning techniques-Random Forest and
  Extreme Gradient Boosting. We mainly focus on the identification of new
gamma-ray pulsar candidates by making use of different
  observational features derived from the long-term observations with the
\emph{Fermi}--LAT and reported in the incremental 4FGL-DR4 catalog.
  We also explore the effects of data balancing approach on the classification
of the \emph{Fermi}--LAT unassociated sources.

TL;DR: 通过1D广义相对论流体动力学模拟，研究中子星发生强子-夸克相变时的中微子辐射特征，发现相变会产生短暂的、光谱更硬的中微子特征信号，可作为夸克物质存在的诊断工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强子-夸克相变在中子星演化中的表现，寻找能够通过中微子观测来探测夸克物质存在的独特特征，以区分传统中子星塌缩和包含相变的塌缩过程。

Method: 使用1D广义相对论流体动力学模拟，采用DD2和MIT Bag模型的状态方程，包含多种中微子产生机制（电子对湮灭、等离子体衰变、核子Urca过程等），并考虑广义相对论红移效应。

Result: 发现中微子光变曲线在相变附近会出现10-50毫秒的短暂硬化特征，表现为肩部或次级峰；识别出三个诊断特征：增强的峰-平台比、塌缩上升与相变特征之间的时间延迟、以及由夸克物质相空间驱动的风味硬化。

Conclusion: 这些特征在MSW风味转换后仍可被现有实验探测到，对于银河系内事件，IceCube和Hyper-K能够分辨出强子-夸克相变特征，并将其与无相变中子星塌缩和标准核心塌缩超新星模板区分开来。

Abstract: We calculate in a 1D General Relativistic (GR) hydrodynamic simulation the
neutrino luminosity in an astrophysical scenario where a neutron star (NS)
displays a hadron-quark phase transition (HQPT) into a Quark Star (QS).
Deconfinement is triggered once the central density exceeds a critical
threshold above $\sim 3n_0$ being $n_0$, saturation density. We use
descriptions based on DD2 and the MIT Bag model equations of state (EOSs). We
account for neutrinos using a microphysics forward emission model including
$e^-e^+$ annihilation, plasmon decay, nucleon (N) modified (or direct) Urca
processes, and $NN$ bremsstrahlung, and, for the post transition, the quark
direct Urca and an opacity-based leakage scheme with GR redshift. We find that
the neutrino light curve generically develops a short $\simeq$10-50 ms,
spectrally harder feature near deconfinement, appearing as either a prompt
shoulder or a distinct secondary peak. Heavy lepton neutrinos result in a
delayed peak with respect to the previous. We identify three diagnostics that
are only mildly degenerate with hadronic uncertainties: (i) an enhanced
peak-to-plateau ratio $R_{\rm pp}$ sourced by latent-heat release, (ii) a
characteristic lag $\Delta t$ between the collapse rise and the HQPT feature
that tracks the central density trajectory, and (iii) a flavor hardening
$\Delta\!\langle E_\nu\rangle$ driven by quark-matter phase space. After MSW
flavor conversion, these signatures remain detectable with current experiments.
For a Galactic event ($d\sim 10$ kpc), IceCube and Hyper-K should resolve the
HQPT feature and distinguish it from both no transition NS collapse and
canonical core-collapse supernova (CCSN) templates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究核心坍缩超新星产生的低频引力波信号，为未来通过匹配滤波进行信号检测和参数估计提供基础

Method: 使用Chimera超新星代码生成三维核心坍缩超新星模型，详细推导微中子各向异性发射产生的引力波信号

Result: 提供了总引力波信号（流体源和微中子源），并分析了低频信号的特性

Abstract: We discuss the low-frequency gravitational wave signals from three
state-of-the-art three-dimensional core-collapse supernova models produced with
the \textsc{Chimera} supernova code. We provide a detailed derivation of the
gravitational wave signal sourced from the anisotropic emission of neutrinos
and provide the total (fluid sourced and neutrino sourced) gravitational waves
signal generated in our models. We discuss the templatablity of this
low-frequency signal, which is useful for future work involving matched
filtering for signal detection and parameter estimation.

TL;DR: 该研究将黑洞图像的自相关技术扩展到可见度域，引入可见度振幅模式速度Ω_VA，用于测量黑洞的视旋转运动，并分析了其对各种参数的依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着事件视界望远镜准备生成黑洞图像序列（电影），需要开发新的技术来测量黑洞的视旋转运动，特别是在可见度域中进行分析。

Method: 将自相关技术从图像域扩展到可见度域，引入可见度振幅模式速度Ω_VA，并基于伊利诺伊v3 EHT源模型库分析其与源倾角、黑洞质量、自旋、吸积状态和基线长度的依赖关系。

Result: Ω_VA对MAD（强磁化）模型的基线长度特别敏感，这种依赖关系的斜率可用于约束黑洞自旋。所有模型参数下，Ω_VA都远低于发射区域的开普勒频率。

Conclusion: Ω_VA测量的是在发射区域传播的波的角相速度，空间毫米波VLBI（如BHEX任务）将提供更多相关信息。

Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope is preparing to produce time sequences of black
hole images, or movies. In anticipation, we developed an autocorrelation
technique to measure apparent rotational motion using the image-domain pattern
speed $\Omega_p$. Here, we extend this technique to the visibility domain and
introduce the visibility amplitude pattern speed $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$. We
show that in the Illinois v3 library of EHT source models,
$\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ depends on the source inclination, black hole mass,
black hole spin, accretion state (MAD or SANE), and baseline length, and then
provide approximate fits for this dependence. We show that
$\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ is particularly sensitive to baseline length for MAD
(strongly magnetized) models, and that the slope of this dependence can be used
to constrain black hole spin. As with $\Omega_p$, models predict that
$\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ is well below the Keplerian frequency in the emission
region for all model parameters. This is consistent with the idea that
$\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ measures an angular phase speed for waves propagating
through the emission region. Finally, we identify the information that would be
provided by space-based millimeter VLBI such as the proposed BHEX mission.

### [5] [A Sharper View of the X-ray Spectrum of MCG--6-30-15 with XRISM, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08926)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 使用XRISM、XMM-Newton和NuSTAR对窄线赛弗特1星系MCG--6-30-15进行联合光谱分析，确认了内吸积盘的反射特征和流出风的多区域电离吸收，强调了时间分辨高分辨率光谱分析对测量可变AGN物理性质的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合宽带和高分辨率X射线光谱学，明确分离和表征MCG--6-30-15中的宽窄发射和吸收特征，以更精确地理解活动星系核的物理过程。

Method: 采用时间平均光谱分析方法，结合XRISM/Resolve、XMM-Newton和NuSTAR的联合观测数据，进行宽带和高分辨率X射线光谱联合分析。

Result: 确认了强相对论性展宽的Fe Kα发射线的存在，发现了~2300 km/s和~20,000 km/s的流出风成分，并表明中性物质反射可能来自非均匀结构而非传统AGN统一模型中的环面。

Conclusion: 尽管快速正向黑洞自旋在统计上更受青睐，但AGN通量变化使时间平均光谱解释复杂化，强调了时间分辨高分辨率光谱分析对准确测量可变AGN物理性质的关键作用。

Abstract: We present a time-averaged spectral analysis of the 2024 XRISM observation of
the narrow-line Seyfert-1 galaxy MCG--6-30-15, taken contemporaneously with
XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. Our analysis leverages a unique combination of broadband
and high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy to definitively isolate and characterize
both broad and narrow emission and absorption features in this source. The
best-fitting model for the joint spectral analysis is very well described by
reflection from the inner accretion disk illuminated by a compact corona,
modified by multi-zone ionized absorption from an outflowing wind along the
line of sight. The XRISM/Resolve data confirm that a strong,
relativistically-broadened Fe K$\alpha$ emission line is required in order to
obtain an adequate model fit. The Resolve data additionally verify the presence
of a $v_{\rm out} \sim 2300$ km/s component of this outflowing wind, find
tentative evidence for a $v_{\rm out} \sim 20,000$ km/s wind component, and
indicate that the reflection from distant, neutral material may originate in a
non-uniform structure rather than the traditional torus of AGN unification
schemes. Though a rapid prograde black hole spin is statistically preferred by
the best-fitting model, consistent with previous results, the AGN flux
variability over the course of the observation complicates the interpretation
of the time-averaged spectra. This insight, clarified by the combination of
high signal-to-noise and high spectral resolution in the joint dataset,
emphasizes the importance of time-resolved, high-resolution spectral analysis
in unambiguously measuring the physical properties of variable AGN.

### [6] [A study of 80 known pulsars at 185 MHz using MWA incoherent drift-scan observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09046)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 使用MWA在185MHz观测80颗已知脉冲星，检测到60%增长，包括30颗首次在该频率检测到的脉冲星，分析了光谱、散射和脉冲宽度特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 进行宽视场低频时域巡天，以约束脉冲星发射和传播特性，为未来SKA-Low等仪器提供经验参考。

Method: 使用MWA电压捕获系统的48次漂移扫描观测数据，覆盖约30,000平方度天空，部署优化的PRESTO搜索管道。

Result: 检测到80颗已知脉冲星，比先前普查增加60%，包括30颗首次在185MHz检测到的脉冲星，提供了脉冲轮廓和通量密度。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了宽视场低频时域巡天在约束脉冲星发射和传播方面的价值，为未来观测提供了经验见解。

Abstract: A systematic study of 80 known pulsars observed at 185 MHz has been conducted
using archival incoherent-sum data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).
The dataset comprises 48 drift-scan observations from the MWA Voltage Capture
System, covering approximately 30,000 square degrees of sky with sensitivities
reaching about 8 mJy in the deepest regions. An optimized PRESTO-based search
pipeline was deployed on the China SKA Regional Centre infrastructure. This
enabled the detection of 80 known pulsars, representing a 60 percent increase
over the previous census. Notably, this includes 30 pulsars with first-time
detections at this frequency, of which pulse profiles and flux densities are
presented. Spectral, scattering, and pulse-width properties were examined for
the sample, providing observational constraints on low-frequency turnover,
propagation effects, and width-period relations. This study highlights the
value of wide-field, low-frequency time-domain surveys for constraining pulsar
emission and propagation, offering empirical insights that may inform future
observations with instruments such as SKA-Low.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 通过3D流体动力学模拟研究超亮X射线源周围气泡星云，发现气泡形态由初始动量决定，机械功率只影响大小，低功率导致气泡壳早期塌缩，观测到的椭圆度由喷流半张角和观测角度共同决定。

Motivation: 研究超亮X射线源周围气泡星云的形成机制和形态特征，理解喷流参数如何影响气泡演化。

Method: 使用AREPO软件进行3D移动网格流体动力学模拟，采用蒙特卡洛方法在圆锥形漏斗中注入均匀质量流出率和动量的外流。

Result: 气泡形态由初始动量决定，机械功率只影响大小，低功率导致冷却时间短和气泡壳早期塌缩，观测椭圆度由喷流半张角和观测角度共同决定。

Conclusion: 模拟结果支持NGC 55 ULX-1和NGC 1313 X-2系统中高速外流被限制在狭窄漏斗区域的假设。

Abstract: We perform 3 dimensional moving-mesh hydrodynamical simulations of bubble
nebulae around ultraluminous X-ray sources, using state-of-the-art software
AREPO. We use a Monte-Carlo method to inject outflows with uniform mass outflow
rate and momentum, in a conical funnel with a specific half opening angle.
Simulation results show that the morphology of the bubble is determined by the
initial momentum of the outflows, while the mechanical power of the outflows
only influences the size of the bubble without changing its shape. Low
mechanical power also results in a short cooling timescale of the system,
leading to an early collapse of the bubble shell. The half opening angle of the
outflows and the viewing angle of the system determine the observed bubble
eccentricity together. Compared with the observational morphology of the ULX
bubble sources NGC 55 ULX-1 and NGC 1313 X-2, our simulation favors the fact
that the high velocity outflows of the accretion disks in these two systems are
confined in a narrow funnel region.

TL;DR: KM3NeT探测到220 PeV超高能中微子事件，研究其在Fermi-LAT数据中可能的GeV-TeV伽马射线对应体，发现了三个亚阈值源，但可能都是背景波动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超高能中微子和伽马射线在宇宙线相互作用中共同产生，KM3NeT探测到的中微子可能伴随可观测的伽马射线信号。

Method: 使用Fermi-LAT望远镜数据，在中微子事件附近搜索瞬变和亚阈值伽马射线源。

Result: 在中微子事件3.5度范围内发现三个TS≥16的亚阈值源，其中一个在观测后出现，另一个有波动，但都可能是背景。

Conclusion: 观测到的亚阈值源数量在相同银纬区域可预期，其波动与背景一致，没有明确证据表明与中微子相关。

Abstract: The KM3NeT collaboration has recently reported the detection of an
extraordinary ultra-high-energy neutrino event with an energy of 220 PeV.
Ultrahigh energy neutrinos and gamma-rays are co-produced in ultrahigh energy
cosmic-ray interactions. The ultrahigh energy gamma-rays produced alongside the
KM3NeT neutrino may quickly cascade down to lower energies due to interactions
with intergalactic photons and magnetic fields. Because of this, the KM3NeT
neutrino could be accompanied by an observable GeV - TeV gamma-ray signal. We
investigate the data collected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the
\textit{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope for transient and sub-threshold
gamma-ray sources in the vicinity of the KM3NeT neutrino. We find three
sub-threshold sources with TS $\gtrsim 16$ within $3.5^{\circ}$ of the neutrino
event not included in any existing \textit{Fermi}-LAT catalogs. One of the
three, J0616.1-0428, is a transient sub-threshold gamma-ray source that appears
only after the neutrino observation, but may be the unrelated flaring of a
nearby microquasar. Another sub-threshold source, J0621.1-0610, also exhibits
fluctuations in gamma-rays immediately following the neutrino observation, and
may be coincident with a radio blazar. We note that the number of sub-threshold
sources observed around the KM3NeT neutrino could be expected at another sky
region of the same Galactic latitude, and that the fluctuations they exhibit
appear to be consistent with background.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该论文研究了千新星光谱中时间延迟效应对谱线特征的影响，特别是P Cygni谱线的发射成分延迟现象，证明了在快速演化的千新星事件中必须考虑时间依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 千新星光谱以小时为单位快速演化，其中AT2017gfo的P Cygni谱线发射成分延迟出现并持续较长时间，理论上归因于回响效应，需要研究光速有限性对光谱特征形状和演化的影响。

Method: 使用简单模型跟踪光子到达观测者的旅程长度，测试在建模千新星时考虑时间延迟效应的必要性，比较时间独立方法与考虑时间延迟方法合成的光谱差异。

Result: 在光球层温度快速演化期间，时间独立方法合成的光谱与考虑时间延迟效应的光谱在视觉上存在明显差异。

Conclusion: 在千新星等快速演化事件中，必须考虑时间依赖性效应。

Abstract: The extremely rapid evolution of kilonovae results in spectra that change on
an hourly basis. These spectra are key to understanding the processes occurring
within the event, but this rapid evolution is an unfamiliar domain compared to
other explosive transient events, such as supernovae. In particular, the most
obvious P Cygni feature in the spectra of AT2017gfo -- commonly attributed to
strontium -- possesses an emission component that emerges after, and ultimately
outlives, its associated absorption dip. This delay is theorised to arise from
reverberation effects, wherein photons emitted earlier in the kilonova's
evolution are scattered before reaching the observer, causing them to be
detected at later times. We aim to examine how the finite speed of light -- and
therefore the light travel time to an observer -- contributes to the shape and
evolution of spectral features in kilonovae. Using a simple model, and tracking
the length of the journey photons undertake to an observer, we are able to test
the necessity of accounting for this time delay effect when modelling
kilonovae. In periods where the photospheric temperature is rapidly evolving,
we show spectra synthesised using a time independent approach are visually
distinct from those where these time delay effects are accounted for.
Therefore, in rapidly evolving events such as kilonovae, time dependence must
be taken into account.

TL;DR: 使用pGMCA算法从钱德拉深场观测中分离出珀尔修斯星系团中极微弱的X射线丝状结构和晃动螺旋结构，首次直接观测到约1.35 keV的低能发射，并获得了最详细的纯净X射线丝状结构图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 珀尔修斯星系团中的Hα丝状结构和晃动螺旋结构极其微弱，其研究受到弥漫热星系团介质的严重干扰，需要开发新方法来分离和提取这些微弱成分。

Method: 采用适应泊松统计的盲源分离算法pGMCA提取形态图，并结合模板拟合方法研究光谱特性。

Result: 首次直接观测到晃动螺旋结构约1.35 keV的低能发射，获得了迄今为止最详细且未被污染的X射线丝状结构图。

Conclusion: pGMCA算法成功分离了珀尔修斯星系团中的微弱X射线成分，为研究星系团中的精细结构提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Deep Chandra observations of the Perseus galaxy cluster have allowed for the
discovery of X-ray counterparts to the H{\alpha} filamentary structures and of
a sloshing spiral. However, both components are extremely faint, and their
study is largely hindered by the volume-filling hot intracluster medium (ICM).
Using the Poisson General Morphological Component Analysis (pGMCA) algorithm, a
blind source separation method adapted for Poissonian statistics, we were able
to extract detailed, clean morphological maps of these components. We then
introduced a template fitting method to investigate their spectral
characteristics. We report the first direct observation of about 1.35 keV
low-energy emission from the sloshing spiral, and produce the most detailed and
unpolluted map of the X-rays filaments thus far obtained.

TL;DR: SN 2021lwz是一种罕见的快速演化超新星，属于超亮超新星的下限范围，在低质量矮星系中爆发，具有低抛射质量和磁星驱动的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SN 2021lwz的物理起源，这是一种在ZTF巡天中发现的罕见快速演化超新星，位于低质量矮星系中，其性质与典型超新星不同。

Method: 使用光学光谱、测光和线性偏振成像数据进行分析和建模，比较其他已知类型的超新星，应用Arnett模型和磁星模型拟合光变曲线。

Result: SN 2021lwz属于快速演化瞬变天体，峰值光度约5×10^43 erg/s，抛射质量约0.24太阳质量，磁星模型比放射性镍模型更适合解释其光变曲线。

Conclusion: SN 2021lwz与许多贫氢核坍缩超新星类型不符，但与SN 2014ft、iPTF 16asu和SN 2018gep等稀有瞬变天体相似。

Abstract: Context. Current large-scale, high-cadence surveys, such as the Zwicky
Transient Facility (ZTF), provide detections of new and rare types of
transients and supernovae whose physical origins are not well understood. Aims.
We investigate the nature of SN 2021lwz at a redshift z=0.065, an overluminous
supernova (SN) of absolute magnitude, $M_{g} \sim -20.1$ AB, falling in the
lower range of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) luminosities, and discovered in
a faint dwarf galaxy with an absolute magnitude of $M_{g} \simeq -14.5$ AB.
Methods. SN 2021lwz is studied using optical spectroscopy, photometry and
imaging linear polarimetry obtained during several follow-up campaigns. All the
data are used to analyse and model the evolution of the explosion. Comparisons
with other SNe of well known or rarer types are investigated. Results. SN
2021lwz belongs to the rare class of rapidly evolving transients. The
bolometric light curve rises in about 7 days to a peak luminosity of about 5
x10^{43} erg/s, at a rate of 0.2 mag/day close to the peak. Spectroscopy
modeling reveals more similarities with a normal Type Ic-like SN than with a
SLSN before peak, showing broadened lines after peak. Light curve modeling
shows that the Arnett model of the bolometric light curve using a radioactive
source ($^{56}$ Ni) is not able to reasonably explain the light curve
evolution. A magnetar model seems more appropriate, suggesting that the
explosion of low ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej} \sim 0.24 ~M_\odot$) took place in a
low mass ($M \sim 10^{6.66}~M_\odot$) dwarf galaxy of specific star-formation
rate about ten times larger than typical star-forming galaxies. Conclusions.
Given its spectroscopic properties and the low ejecta mass needed to model its
light-curve, SN 2021lwz does not match with many core-collapse H-poor SNe
Types. It shares similarities with rarer transients like SN 2014ft, iPTF 16asu
and SN 2018gep.

proliferation of algorithmic applications for encoding, characterizing, and
acting on complex data that may contain many high dimensional features.
Recently, the emergence of deep-learning models trained across very large
datasets has created a new paradigm for machine learning in the form of
Foundation Models. Foundation Models are programs trained on very large and
broad datasets with an extensive number of parameters. Once built, these
powerful, and flexible, models can be utilized in less resource-intensive ways
to build many different, downstream applications that can integrate previously
disparate, multimodal data. The development of these applications can be done
rapidly and with a much lower demand for machine learning expertise. And the
necessary infrastructure and models themselves are already being established
within agencies such as NASA and ESA. At NASA this work is across several
divisions of the Science Mission Directorate including the NASA Goddard and
INDUS Large Language Models and the Prithvi Geospatial Foundation Model. And
ESA initiatives to bring Foundation Models to Earth observations has led to the
development of TerraMind. A workshop was held by the NASA Ames Research Center
and the SETI Institute, in February 2025, to investigate the potential of
Foundation Models for astrobiological research and to determine what steps
would be needed to build and utilize such a model or models. This paper shares
the findings and recommendations of that workshop, and describes clear
near-term, and future opportunities in the development of a Foundation Model
(or Models) for astrobiology applications. These applications would include a
biosignature, or life characterization, task, a mission development and
operations task, and a natural language task for integrating and supporting
astrobiology research needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂有机分子在恒星形成区域中含量丰富，但其毫米波谱包含数百条谱线，谱线混合阻碍分析。需要新方法来识别气体分子组成

Method: 使用局部热力学平衡模型构建合成光谱数据集，设计并训练卷积神经网络来提供单个物种的检测概率

Conclusion: CNN方法有效促进复杂毫米波谱分析，在合成光谱和观测数据测试中均表现良好

Abstract: Complex organic molecules (COMs) are observed to be abundant in various
astrophysical environments, in particular toward star forming regions they are
observed both toward protostellar envelopes as well as shocked regions.
Emission spectrum especially of heavier COMs may consists of up to hundreds of
lines, where line blending hinders the analysis. However, identifying the
molecular composition of the gas leading to the observed millimeter spectra is
the first step toward a quantitative analysis. We develop a new method based on
supervised machine learning to recognize spectroscopic features of the
rotational spectrum of molecules in the 3mm atmospheric transmission band for a
list of species including COMs with the aim to obtain a detection probability.
We used local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) modeling to build a large set of
synthetic spectra of 20 molecular species including COMs with a range of
physical conditions typical for star forming regions. We successfully designed
and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that provides detection
probabilities of individual species in the spectra. We demonstrate that the
produced CNN-model has a robust performance to detect spectroscopic signatures
from these species in synthetic spectra. We evaluate its ability to detect
molecules according to the noise level, frequency coverage, and line-richness,
and also test its performance for incomplete frequency coverage with high
detection probabilities for the tested parameter space, and no false
predictions. Ultimately, we apply the CNN-model to obtain predictions on
observational data from the literature toward line-rich hot-core like sources,
where detection probabilities remain reasonable with no false detection. We
prove the use of CNNs facilitating the analysis of complex millimeter spectra
both on synthetic spectra as well as first tests on observational data.

Abstract: In the era of exploding survey volumes, traditional methods of spectroscopic
analysis are being pushed to their limits. In response, we develop deep-REMAP,
a novel deep learning framework that utilizes a regularized, multi-task
approach to predict stellar atmospheric parameters from observed spectra. We
train a deep convolutional neural network on the PHOENIX synthetic spectral
library and use transfer learning to fine-tune the model on a small subset of
observed FGK dwarf spectra from the MARVELS survey. We then apply the model to
732 uncharacterized FGK giant candidates from the same survey. When validated
on 30 MARVELS calibration stars, deep-REMAP accurately recovers the effective
temperature ($T_{\rm{eff}}$), surface gravity ($\log \rm{g}$), and metallicity
([Fe/H]), achieving a precision of, for instance, approximately 75 K in
$T_{\rm{eff}}$. By combining an asymmetric loss function with an embedding
loss, our regression-as-classification framework is interpretable, robust to
parameter imbalances, and capable of capturing non-Gaussian uncertainties.
While developed for MARVELS, the deep-REMAP framework is extensible to other
surveys and synthetic libraries, demonstrating a powerful and automated pathway
for stellar characterization.

Abstract: Context. In the current era of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger
astronomy, international organisations are actively working on the definition
of new standards for the publication of astronomical data, and substantial
effort is devoted to make them available through public archives. Aims. We
present a set of tools that allow user-friendly access and basic scientific
analysis of observations in Hierarchical Progressive Survey (HiPS) format, and
we use them to gauge the quality of representative skymaps at ultraviolet,
optical, and infrared wavelengths. Methods. We apply a fully-automatic
procedure to derive aperture photometry in 10 different bands for the 323
nearby galaxies in the Herschel Reference Sample (HRS), and compare its results
with the rigorous analyses involving specialised knowledge and human
intervention carried out by the HRS team. Results. Our experiment shows that 9
of the 10 skymaps considered preserve the original quality of the data, and the
photometric fluxes returned by our pipeline are consistent with the HRS
measurements within a few per cent. In the case of Herschel PACS maps at 100
{\mu}m, we uncovered a systematic error that we ascribe to an inconsistent
combination of data products with different spatial resolution. For the
remaining skymaps, the estimated statistical uncertainties provide a realistic
indication of the differences with respect to the HRS catalogue. Conclusions.
In principle, the currently available HiPS skymaps in Flexible Image Transport
System (FITS) format allow to carry out broadband photometric analyses with an
accuracy of the order of a few percent, but some level human intervention is
still required. In addition to assessing data quality, we also propose a series
of recommendations to realise the full potential of the HiPS format for the
scientific analysis of large astronomical data sets.
