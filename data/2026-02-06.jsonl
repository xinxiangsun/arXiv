In spite of its primary importance, an exact theoretical treatment is only possible for a limited range of ideal cases, while realistic situations require the development of numerical solutions. In the course of the years, several techniques were developed to model the effects of scattering and absorption in more general cases, using approaches such as the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA), the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method, the Transition Matrix formalism (T-matrix) or the Mean Field Theory (MFT). Among these possibilities, the T-matrix approach grants the highest degree of flexibility in modeling aggregates of spherically symmetric particles with arbitrary overall morphology and composition, but its application has been limited by the challenging computational requirements of the method in realistic cases. This paper describes the Nano-Particle Transition Matrix Code project (NP_TMcode), a new implementation of the T-matrix formalism that, taking advantage of high performance parallel hardware architectures, allows the solution of increasingly complex models, while substantially reducing the computing time. The paper describes the code structure, with a particular focus on the algorithm optimization, and it presents the results of the performance analysis for a set of development applications."}

Parallel dual tree traversal for the symmetric fast multipole method", "comment": null, "summary": "Tree codes that approximate groups of distant particles with multipole expansions are the standard way to accelerate the computation of self-gravity on particles. While momentum-conserving fast multipole methods exist, parallelisation is non-trivial and previous implementations have been limited to self-gravity with fixed softening lengths. We aim for a practical, parallel version of Dehnen's momentum-conserving Cartesian fast multipole method for the computation of the gravitational force in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with adaptive gravitational force softening. We parallelise the dual tree walk by replicating the node-node interaction on the parents of each leaf node in the tree. While this duplicates work, it greatly simplifies the parallelisation and can be implemented with relatively minor changes from the previous non-conservative force algorithm in Phantom. We also adapt the tree opening criterion for adaptive softening lengths, such that all interactions within the softening kernel are handled pairwise (as in SPH) rather than with multipole expansions, also allowing the gravity calculation to be performed alongside the SPH force evaluation. We demonstrate that the new code conserves linear momentum to machine precision while giving similar force accuracy and computational performance to the previous (non-symmetric) fast multipole method in Phantom . The new method also gives better conservation of the angular momentum and orbital phase in a binary polytrope evolution. The symmetric fast multipole method is now the default for computing self-gravity in the public code."}

Submitted to A&A. Comments welcome", "summary": "Bayesian imaging inverse problems in astrophysics and cosmology remain challenging, particularly in low-data regimes, due to complex forward operators and the frequent lack of well-motivated priors for non-Gaussian signals. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian approach that addresses these difficulties by relying on a low-dimensional representation of physical fields built from Scattering Transform statistics. This representation enables inference to be performed in a compact model space, where we recover a posterior distribution over signal models that are consistent with the observed data. We propose an iterative adaptive algorithm to efficiently approximate this posterior distribution. We apply our method to a large-scale structure column density field from the Quijote simulations, using a realistic instrumental forward operator. We demonstrate both accurate statistical inference and deterministic signal reconstruction from a single contaminated image, without relying on any external prior distribution for the field of interest. These results demonstrate that Scattering Transform statistics provide an effective representation for solving complex imaging inverse problems in challenging low-data regimes. Our approach opens the way to new applications for non-Gaussian astrophysical and cosmological signals for which little or no prior modeling is available."}

Calibration along a set of discrete directions in the sky is the default technique to estimate and correct these systematic errors. However, additional processing such as smoothing and mosaicing are required to reconcile the step wise variation of the estimated systematic errors at the edges of the discrete directions (facets). We overcome the discrete nature of direction-dependent calibration by using image-domain gridding as the model for the calibration. Instead of discrete directions in the sky, calibration is performed using a basis that represents a set of sub-grids in the Fourier space. This automatically removes the need for extra operations to recover the wide-field systematics error model without any discontinuity. We provide results based on LOFAR data where we compare the traditional facet-based (discrete directional gains) calibration with the proposed approach. The comparison shows improved image quality, mainly because of the physical plausibility of the proposed approach as opposed to using a piecewise constant model for direction-dependent systematic errors."}

This population is also the most sensitive to SMBH seeding and early growth models. In this work we construct a semi-empirical model for the redshift evolution of the TDE rate under multiple SMBH mass function prescriptions, and show that the observed redshift-dependent rate of TDEs is very sensitive to the SMBH mass function and its evolution with redshift. We further incorporate galaxy-scale processes that evolve with redshift -- namely, increasing galaxy nuclear stellar densities, enhanced galaxy-galaxy merger rates, dust obscuration, and a possible top-heavy IMF at early cosmic times -- and quantify their combined impact on the TDE rate. We find that including these effects generally results in a volumetric TDE rate that increases with redshift until a maximum near cosmic noon, before declining at higher redshift where SMBHs that can disrupt stars become increasingly scarce. We forecast TDE rates in the Rubin LSST and the Roman High Latitude Time Domain Survey, alongside expectations for serendipitous TDE rates in the JWST COSMOS-Web survey. Finally, we provide a methodology for using a flux-limited survey of TDEs in LSST to directly constrain the redshift evolution of the SMBH mass function."}

We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary cluster mergers coupled to tracer particles and a Fokker--Planck solver to model the radio emission. Exploring variations in the most likely initial conditions within the ICM-SHOX parameter space, such as the relative cluster velocity and impact parameter, we find that the resulting merger configuration consistently produces two merger-driven shocks with typical average Mach numbers $\\mathcal{M}_s \\sim 2$--$3$ with corresponding standard deviations of $σ_{\\mathcal{M}} \\sim 0.5$--$1.5$.

By analyzing the Fermi-LAT data, a significant (globally 7.7$σ$) $γ$-ray source in its direction, with an estimated association probability of 0.91, is observed in a half-year period of 2025. The analyses also reveal the emergence of co-spatial $γ$-ray residues in prior epochs. Moreover, the $γ$-ray and infrared light curves are likely correlated, particularly, the two emissions climb to the peaking values at the same time.

In this scenario, the envelope of the prompt light curve follows the time-dependent mass-supply history to the central engine, associated with stellar collapse and, where applicable, fallback accretion, whose early-time onset can be approximated by $\\dot{M}\\propto t^{0-1/2}$ and which subsequently may decay as $\\dot{M}\\propto t^{-5/3}$, producing a photon count rate with a single fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED)-like profile. In general, the prompt-emission envelope is regulated by a time-dependent mass supply to the central engine, while internal shocks produce the rapid variability. Since we only aim to introduce this framework here, we focus on the simplest single-FRED shape of the prompt emission profiles, while more complex cases involving multiple episodes and interacting shocks will be explored in forthcoming studies. The model indicates correlations between spectral evolution, FRED-pulse narrowing at high energies, and the mass-supply-controlled envelope. Stochastic Lorentz factor variations of ejected mass- or rate-driven shells, superimposed on the Accretion-Modulated envelope, explain the coexistence of smooth global trends and irregular short-timescale features, such as the widths of individual pulses in long GRB light curves, offering diagnostic tools for probing the inner engine activity."}

The $γ$-ray emission exhibits a distinct two-episode (``double-burst'') structure. Rapid follow-up observations in the optical and X-ray bands provide full coverage of the second burst. The optical light curve begins to rise approximately 135 s after the trigger, significantly preceding the second emission episode observed in X-rays and $γ$-rays at $\\sim 320$ s. This chromatic behavior suggests different physical origins for the optical and high-energy emissions. Joint broadband spectral fitting (optical to $γ$-rays) during the second episode reveals that a two-component model, consisting of a power-law plus a Band function, provides a superior fit compared to single-component models. We interpret the power-law component as the afterglow of the first burst (dominating the optical band), while the Band component is attributed to the prompt emission of the second burst (dominating the high-energy bands). A physical synchrotron model is also found to be a viable candidate to explain the high-energy emission. Regarding the afterglow, the early optical light curve displays a sharp transition from a rise of $\\sim t^{2.5}$ to $\\sim t^{6.5}$, which is well-explained by a scenario involving both reverse shock (RS) and forward shock (FS) components.

To address this, we propose using the luminosity decay slope (parameter d) of GRB light curves to distinguish between the BZ and NDAF mechanisms, thereby linking the light-curve morphology to the central engine physics. By analysing 85 single-peaked GRBs with fast-rise, exponential-decay (FRED) profiles observed by Swift/BAT using 64 ms background-subtracted light curves, we fit the decay slope (parameter d) with the empirical Kocevski-Ryde-Liang (KRL) function and compare the results with theoretical predictions for the BZ (d approximately 1.67) and the NDAF (d approximately 3.7 to 7.8) mechanisms. We find that the decay slope (parameter d) can differentiate central engine mechanisms, with 15 GRBs consistent with the BZ mechanism and 22 supporting the NDAF mechanism. However, most events exhibit slopes within the range between 2 and 4, suggesting a hybrid of mechanisms, with NDAF being dominant."}

Although a full description of the continuous and transient emission from blazars seems to require more sophisticated scenarios, particle acceleration and loss mechanisms can be approximately described within the simple leptonic one-zone framework, enabling a systematic study of their impact on the observable properties of multiwavelength flare light curves. Our goal is to identify characteristic signatures in these light curve profiles that permit one to discriminate between the main physical processes situated inside the relativistic jet and commonly invoked to explain blazar flares. The present study exclusively focuses on modeling rapid flares from BL Lac type objects, which can be described within the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission scenario. Combinations of several commonly employed mechanisms to describe the gain and loss of energetic particles in onezone models during flaring events are studied in a systematic way: particle injection; diffusive shock and stochastic acceleration and reacceleration; particle escape; adiabatic losses; radiative losses through synchrotron and inverse-Compton radiation. The current study is limited to the case of \"hard-sphere\" scattering. A large variety of light curve shapes arises from the different scenarios under study. Characteristic signatures, in particular energy-dependent time delays and differences in the shapes of the rising part of the flare, should allow the distinction to be made between different injection and acceleration scenarios, given the availability of sufficiently high-quality multiwavelength data sets. This is illustrated with a simplified application to a flare event from the blazar Mrk 421."}

Using a Plummer model as a readily interpretable baseline, we derive analytic scaling relations between the peak of the inferred host mass posterior, the GW-driven recoil velocity of the remnant, and the parameters that determine the structure of the host. We then perform exact numerical marginalization over thermal and recoil velocities, angles, and cluster structure parameters, to infer the host-mass posterior. We apply our framework to putative hierarchical mergers GW241011 and GW241110, and infer the masses of their hosts on a single-event basis.

Also, the effective potential and the corresponding effective force are constructed to quantify the influence of rotation and embedding parameters on the attractive and repulsive sectors of the gravitational interaction. Closed-form expressions for orbital frequencies as measured by a distant observer are derived, enabling a quantitative analysis of relativistic precession phenomena, including periastron advance and Lense-Thirring precession. Furthermore, we conduct general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of BHL accretion onto rotating embedded BHs. In addition, within the framework of the BHL accretion mechanism, the numerical solution of the GRH equations shows that the embedding parameter αsystematically modifies the morphology of the shock cone formed around embedded BHs compared to the Kerr model. In particular, a wider opening angle of the cone is produced, the compression of matter in the post-shock region is weakened, and the dynamical variability of the flow is enhanced. The time-dependent mass accretion rate exhibits increasing oscillation amplitudes and long-term variations with increasing α, while these amplitudes are found to be suppressed by the frame-dragging effect associated with the BH spin parameter. At the same time, increasing values of $α$ lead to a strengthening of the QPO frequencies formed around embedded BHs in the LFQPO regime, enhancing their observability and increasing the likelihood of detecting commensurate frequency ratios such as 3:2."}

This analysis utilizes the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma ray Observatory to indirectly search for dark matter (DM) by studying gamma ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Selected for their high ratio of dark matter to baryonic matter, dSphs are useful for this type of search owing to the low background emission. In comparison to previous HAWC studies, we significantly improve our sensitivity to DM from dSphs due to improvements to our event reconstruction and reduced hadronic contamination. We expanded the number of dSphs studied, DM annihilation channels into the Standard Model (SM), and the amount of data collected on each previously studied dSph. We searched for DM signals in each dSph using the latest version of the algorithms used to reconstruct data from the primary detector of the HAWC instrument. We report that we do not detect evidence of DM from dSphs, so we place upper limits for the velocity-weighted DM annihilation cross-section ($\\langleσv \\rangle$) on the order of $10^{-23}~\\text{cm}^3\\text{s}^{-1}$ for a DM mass range of $1-10^4$ TeV."}

In this work, we investigate the CCF of the Z-source GX 349+2 using an XMM-Newton observation. We noted that asymmetric CCFs with lags of a few hundred secondsbetween soft and hard band LCs in the horizontal branch, whereas CCFs remained symmetric in normal and flaring branches. We also performed a CCF study during the flux transition duration and observed lags of the order of a few tens to hundreds of seconds. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess the robustness of these CCFs, confirming their significance at a 95% confidence level. Spectral analysis during the flux transitions further suggests that the inner accretion disk extends close to the last stable orbit. We propose that the observed hard lags arise from the readjustment of the boundary layer/coronal region located near the inner edge of the accretion disk. From the measured lags, we estimate the characteristic size of the boundary layer. We show that the observed lags could also be associated with the depletion timescale of the boundary layer with low viscosity."}
