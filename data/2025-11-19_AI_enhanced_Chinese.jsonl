We developed CHASM (Coronal Hole Annotation using Semi-automatic Methods), a software tool for semi-automatic annotation that enables users to rapidly and accurately annotate SWPC maps. The CHASM tool enabled us to annotate 1,111 CH masks, comprising the CHASM-SWPC-1111 dataset. We then trained multiple CHRONNOS (Coronal Hole RecOgnition Neural Network Over multi-Spectral-data) architecture (Jarolim et al. 2021) neural networks using the CHASM-SWPC dataset and compared their performance. Training the CHRONNOS neural network on these data achieved an accuracy of 0.9805, a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.6807, and an intersection-over-union (IoU) of 0.5668, which is higher than the original pretrained CHRONNOS model Jarolim et al.

Small telescopes offer several advantages: they are cost-effective, occupy less space, and are simpler to set up than larger instruments. This makes them particularly suitable for amateur astronomers and educational institutions with limited resources. Moreover, small telescopes can effectively observe bright celestial objects, enabling valuable contributions to astronomical projects. Based on the Sol'EX design, SPECTRUMMATE was constructed using optical components available at the Space and Applications Laboratory (SpaceLAB), University of Science and Technology of Hanoi, Vietnam. The instrument is designed to meet the specific needs of astronomers who require detailed analysis within the visible spectrum (SPECTRUMMATE can capture a waveband of 368 angstrom/image, spectral coverage from 4000 to 6600 angstrom, and resolving power R = 2546 at 5500 angstrom). To achieve optimal performance, the design process involved selecting and configuring optical elements, including a collimator, diffraction grating, and objective lens. Experimental setups were tested to minimize spectral dispersion while ensuring the system's compactness and ease of alignment. Spectra obtained by SPECTRUMMATE demonstrated efficient spectral calibration and the capability to capture high-resolution spectra of bright light sources, such as the Sun, making it a valuable tool for specialised spectroscopic observations. The modular design of SPECTRUMMATE also allows users to change its components easily to achieve the desired spectral range and resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aSPECTRUMMATE\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u5c0f\u578b\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSol'EX\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u8c31\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u578b\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3001\u5360\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c0f\u3001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4e1a\u4f59\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u5bb6\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u673a\u6784\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89c2\u6d4b\u660e\u4eae\u5929\u4f53\u5e76\u4e3a\u5929\u6587\u9879\u76ee\u505a\u51fa\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSol'EX\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SpaceLAB\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u914d\u7f6e\u51c6\u76f4\u5668\u3001\u884d\u5c04\u5149\u6805\u548c\u7269\u955c\u7b49\u5149\u5b66\u5143\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5149\u8c31\u8272\u6563\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u6613\u5bf9\u51c6\u6027\u3002", "result": "SPECTRUMMATE\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u83b7368\u57c3/\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6ce2\u6bb5\uff0c\u5149\u8c31\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f44000-6600\u57c3\uff0c\u57285500\u57c3\u5904\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e3a2546\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u8c31\u6821\u51c6\u5e76\u6355\u83b7\u592a\u9633\u7b49\u660e\u4eae\u5149\u6e90\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u3002", "conclusion": "SPECTRUMMATE\u662f\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9d\u8d35\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5176\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u8f7b\u677e\u66f4\u6362\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002"}}

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), with their extreme luminosities and high-redshift detectability, provide a unique window into the history of cosmic formation and chemical evolution. Consequently, the GRB formation rate (FR) has been employed to trace the star formation rate (SFR) across cosmic time. GRBs are conventionally classified into long and short categories (lGRBs and sGRBs) based on their $ T_{90} $ duration. sGRBs are widely employed as tracers of the delayed SFR, owing to their origin linked to the inspiral timescales of compact binary systems. However, some studies suggest that the detection of supernova-associated sGRBs may indicate potential contamination by core-collapse events. In this work, we move beyond the $ T_{90} $ classification and focus exclusively on GRBs with confirmed kilonova signatures, which provide unambiguous evidence of binary compact star mergers, to reassess their connection with the delayed SFR. Through analysis of a kilonova-associated GRB (KN/GRBs) sample, we find that even within this robust subset, the KN/GRB FR displays a trend contrary to that of the delayed SFR at low redshifts ($ z < 1 $). This result challenges the conventional theory by indicating that low-redshift KN/GRBs may not accurately trace the delayed SFR, independent of core-collapse contamination, while further validation with larger KN/GRB samples is essential to determine the reliability of compact binary mergers as probes of delayed SFR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5177\u6709\u5343\u65b0\u661f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u66b4\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f4e\u7ea2\u79fb\u7684KN/GRB\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u8d8b\u52bf\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u77ed\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u66b4\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u7684\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u5343\u65b0\u661f\u7279\u5f81\u7684GRBs\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdfSFR\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u7684T90\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u786e\u8ba4\u5343\u65b0\u661f\u7279\u5f81\u7684GRBs\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u53cc\u81f4\u5bc6\u661f\u5e76\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29\u6c61\u67d3\u7684KN/GRBs\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f4e\u7ea2\u79fb(z < 1)\u7684KN/GRB\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u8d8b\u52bf\u76f8\u53cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4e\u7ea2\u79fb\u7684KN/GRBs\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5927\u7684KN/GRB\u6837\u672c\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53cc\u81f4\u5bc6\u661f\u5e76\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5ef6\u8fdfSFR\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

A differential piston, arising from either the adaptive optics (AO) control loop, thermomechanical effects, or other sources, significantly degrades the image quality and is detrimental to the telescope's overall performance. In a numerical simulation set-up, we propose a method for estimating the differential piston between the petals of the ELT's M4 mirror using images from a 2x2 Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SH-WFS), commonly used in the ELT's tomographic AO mode. We aim to identify the limitations of this approach by evaluating its sensitivity to various observing conditions and sources of noise. Using a deep learning model based on a ResNet architecture, we trained a neural network (NN) on simulated datasets to estimate the differential piston. We assessed the robustness of the method under various conditions, including variations in Strehl ratio, polychromaticity, and detector noise. The performance was quantified using the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated differential piston aberration. This method demonstrates the ability to extract differential piston information from 2x2 SH-WFS images. Temporal averaging of frames makes the differential piston signal emerge from the turbulence-induced speckle field and leads to a significant improvement in the RMSE calculation. As expected, better seeing conditions result in improved accuracy. Polychromaticity only degrades the performance by less than 5% compared to the monochromatic case. In a realistic scenario, detector noise is not a limiting factor, as the primary limitation rather arises from the need for sufficient speckle averaging. The network was also shown to be applicable to input images other than the 2x2 SH-WFS data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u6d3b\u585e\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u75282x2 Shack-Hartmann\u6ce2\u524d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1ELT M4\u955c\u9762\u82b1\u74e3\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u6d3b\u585e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ResNet\u67b6\u6784\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6e90\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740ELT\u63a5\u8fd1\u8fd0\u884c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u6210\u50cf\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7531\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u5b66\u63a7\u5236\u56de\u8def\u3001\u70ed\u673a\u68b0\u6548\u5e94\u7b49\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u6d3b\u585e\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eResNet\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u5dee\u5206\u6d3b\u585e\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65af\u7279\u5217\u5c14\u6bd4\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u591a\u8272\u6027\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ece2x2 SH-WFS\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5dee\u5206\u6d3b\u585e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u5e27\u4f7f\u5dee\u5206\u6d3b\u585e\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ece\u6e4d\u6d41\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u6563\u6591\u573a\u4e2d\u663e\u73b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584RMSE\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u591a\u8272\u6027\u4ec5\u4f7f\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0d\u52305%\uff0c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u6d3b\u585e\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u662f\u5173\u952e\u6539\u8fdb\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e5f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e2x2 SH-WFS\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u5916\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u3002"}}

Galaxy mergers are proposed as very high-energy CR accelerators, which are expected to produce high-energy (HE) $\u03b3$ rays and neutrinos through interactions with the ambient gas and low-energy background radiation fields. For the first time, we systematically study the HE $\u03b3$-ray emission from galaxy mergers utilising 16.7 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) data with the sample list compiled from eight survey catalogs. Our analysis finds 8 galaxy mergers that exhibit $\u03b3$-ray emission with significance $\\gtrsim5\u03c3$ in the 1-500 GeV energy range. A stacking analysis of the remaining faint galaxy mergers yields a combined $\u03b3$-ray emission detected at $\\sim 35\u03c3$ significance, a best-fit spectral index of $\u0393\\approx 2.07$, and an energy flux of $\\sim \\rm 2\\times10^{-14}~erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$. We compare the stacked spectral energy distributions of the galaxy mergers with the projected sensitivity of the upcoming $\u03b3$-ray telescope Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).

It is usually thought that the BHs are of second (or higher) generation (2G), resulting from the mergers of smaller BHs. But the physical processes that produce the merging 2G BH binaries are unclear and highly unconstrained. We show that such 2G mergers can be naturally produced in the nuclear star cluster of Milky Way-like galaxy. The dominant channel combines a sequence of binary-single interactions with secular evolution driven by the central supermassive BH. Our model produces a merger rate consistent with GW231123 and further predicts an abundant population of 2G BH-star (or low-mass BH) binaries; these binaries may observationally manifest as micro tidal disruption events or low-frequency gravitational-wave (GW) sources.

Our analysis shows that the traditional equipartition estimate works well at the kpc scale of the simulation box, but breaks down at smaller scales. We find that the predicted magnetic field strength can be improved at small scales by assuming a constant CR energy density across each mock radio observation. The large-scale mean CR energy density can be estimated by assuming equipartition with the large-scale mean magnetic energy density, or as a function of additional observable quantities such as the star formation rate surface density or gas weight. In addition to estimating the magnetic field strength, we use synthetic polarized emission to create maps of the magnetic field direction.

However, the observational probes of the connections between magnetars and FRBs are severely limited by the paucity of detection of highly energetic radio events from magnetars -- to date, only one radio burst as energetic as FRBs has been detected from a Galactic magnetar. Here, we present a detailed analysis of a large sample of low-energy bursts detected from the magnetar XTE J1810$-$197, and probe their implications for FRB emission from magnetars. We report detection of over 97000 bright radio pulses from 242 observations of the magnetar XTE J1810$-$197 over 4.5 years and two decades in frequency (300 MHz to 6.15 GHz), using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope, after its recent outburst onset in December 2018. We present detailed analysis of the burst fluence distributions and their trends with time as well as frequency, and the waiting time distribution. We show that XTE J1810$-$197 rapidly switches between pulsar-like and giant-pulse-like emission states, and magnetars like XTE J1810$-$197 remain viable and likely emitters of FRBs, in the form of giant-pulses with energies comparable to FRBs. We also demonstrate that the lack of the detection of an underlying periodicity in the bursts from repeating FRBs might be caused by emission across a wide range of spin phases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u78c1\u661fXTE J1810-197\u7684242\u6b21\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u8d85\u8fc797000\u4e2a\u660e\u4eae\u5c04\u7535\u8109\u51b2\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7206\u53d1\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u9891\u7387\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u78c1\u661f\u5728\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u6001\u548c\u5de8\u8109\u51b2\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u5feb\u901f\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u78c1\u661f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u5c04\u7535\u66b4\u53d1\u5c04\u6e90\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u78c1\u661f\u662f\u5feb\u901f\u5c04\u7535\u66b4(FRBs)\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5019\u9009\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bc1\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4ec5\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u4e00\u6b21\u6765\u81ea\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u78c1\u661f\u7684\u9ad8\u80fd\u5c04\u7535\u7206\u53d1\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u78c1\u661f\u4e0eFRBs\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5de8\u578b\u7c73\u6ce2\u5c04\u7535\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u548c\u7eff\u5cb8\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\uff0c\u57284.5\u5e74\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5bf9\u78c1\u661fXTE J1810-197\u8fdb\u884c242\u6b21\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u8986\u76d6300 MHz\u81f36.15 GHz\u9891\u6bb5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7206\u53d1\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u9891\u7387\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u8d85\u8fc797000\u4e2a\u660e\u4eae\u5c04\u7535\u8109\u51b2\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u78c1\u661f\u5728\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u6001\u548c\u5de8\u8109\u51b2\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u5feb\u901f\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u5176\u5de8\u8109\u51b2\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0eFRBs\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u7206\u53d1\u53ef\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u5bbd\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u76f8\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u50cfXTE J1810-197\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u78c1\u661f\u4ecd\u7136\u662fFRBs\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u6e90\uff0c\u4ee5\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0eFRBs\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5de8\u8109\u51b2\u5f62\u5f0f\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u91cd\u590dFRB\u4e2d\u672a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u5468\u671f\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u7206\u53d1\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u5bbd\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u76f8\u4f4d\u3002"}}

Through gravitational heating and angular-momentum exchange, the companion excavates a \"scoured\" region that lowers the inner density and suppresses the expected annihilation signal. We quantify this effect by computing the suppression of the dark-matter annihilation $J$-factor induced by such a companion, combining an analytic scouring-radius model with full numerical integrations of the modified density profile. We scan the parameter space of companion mass, orbital separation, system age, and spike slope, explicitly including the interplay with the annihilation plateau. For canonical Gondolo-Silk spikes with $\u03b3_{\\rm sp} \\gtrsim 2$, we find that the distribution is remarkably resilient and that the companion produces at most mild reductions of the $J$-factor. In contrast, for pre-heated or otherwise shallow spikes with $\u03b3_{\\rm sp} \\lesssim 1.8$, even a modest $\\sim 10^{4}\\,M_\\odot$ companion on a O(100) AU orbit and O(Gyr) age can suppress the annihilation flux by one to two orders of magnitude. The numerical results are accurately captured (typically at the $\\lesssim 10\\%$ level) by a simple fitting formula in terms of a dimensionless scouring parameter that measures the ratio between the scoured region and the annihilation core. Our findings demonstrate that neglecting a dark companion can lead to substantial overestimates of the Galactic Center $J$-factor, with direct consequences for interpreting gamma-ray, neutrino, and antimatter searches for annihilating dark matter.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u4f34\u661f\uff08\u5982\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff09\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u52a0\u70ed\u548c\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u91cd\u5851\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5c16\u5cf0\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6e6e\u706d\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u4f34\u661f\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6e6e\u706d\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u6e6e\u706d\u901a\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u51b2\u5237\u534a\u5f84\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5256\u9762\u7684\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u626b\u63cf\u4f34\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8f68\u9053\u5206\u79bb\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u5c16\u5cf0\u659c\u7387\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5178\u578bGondolo-Silk\u5c16\u5cf0\uff08\u03b3_sp \u2273 2\uff09\uff0c\u4f34\u661f\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff1b\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6d45\u5c16\u5cf0\uff08\u03b3_sp \u2272 1.8\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u4f34\u661f\u4e5f\u80fd\u5c06\u6e6e\u706d\u901a\u91cf\u6291\u52361-2\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5ffd\u7565\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u4f34\u661f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6e6e\u706d\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u9ad8\u4f30\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u3001\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u548c\u53cd\u7269\u8d28\u63a2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

At the same time, the gamma-ray flux produced by such a population of blazars is consistent with the diffuse gamma-ray flux measured by the Fermi Large Area Telescope.", "AI": {"tldr": "KM3NeT\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230220PeV\u8d85\u9ad8\u80fd\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u7fa4\u4f53\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f8\u7b26\u7684\u5f25\u6563\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u901a\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5176\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u901a\u91cf\u4e0eFermi LAT\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5f25\u6563\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u901a\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "KM3NeT\u5408\u4f5c\u7ec4\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u8fc4\u4eca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u7ea6220PeV\uff09\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u5728\u6700\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u5904\u5b58\u5728\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u901a\u91cf\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8be5\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u8d77\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u5929\u4f53\u591a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u5efa\u6a21\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u901a\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u7fa4\u4f53\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0eKM3NeT/ARCA\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u8d85\u9ad8\u80fd\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u5bb9\u7684\u5f25\u6563\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u901a\u91cf\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u901a\u91cf\u4e0eFermi\u5927\u89c6\u573a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5f25\u6563\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u901a\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u7fa4\u4f53\u53ef\u80fd\u662fKM3NeT\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u8d85\u9ad8\u80fd\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u901a\u91cf\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f8\u7b26\u3002"}}

These components span a broad range of ionization parameters and column densities, producing absorption features across both soft and hard X-ray bands.

The soft X-ray UFO component, despite its lower ionization, shares a similar velocity as a higher-ionization component, hinting at a two-phase medium likely shaped by clumpiness or interactions with ambient material.

For many events, the radio synchrotron emission is inferred to originate from the interaction of mildly-relativistic outflows, launched with delay times of $\\sim 100$--$1000$ d after the TDE optical peak. The mechanism behind these outflows remains uncertain, but may relate to instabilities or state transitions in the accretion disk formed from the TDE. We model the radio emission powered by the collision of mass outflows (\"flares\") from TDE accretion disks, considering scenarios in which two successive disk flares collide with each other, as well as collisions between the outflow and the circumnuclear medium (CNM). For flare masses of $\\sim 0.01$-$0.1 M_{\\odot}$, varied CNM densities, and different time intervals between ejected flares, we demonstrate that the shocks formed by the collisions have velocities $0.05c$-$0.3c$ at $\\sim 10^{17}$ cm and power bright radio emission of $L_\u03bd \\sim 10^{27}$-$10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, consistent with the properties inferred for observed events. We quantify how the typical peak timescale and flux varies for different properties of our models, and compare our model predictions to a selection of TDEs with delayed radio emission. Our models successfully reproduce the light curves and SEDs for several events, supporting the idea that delayed outflows from disk instabilities and state transitions can power late-time radio emission in TDEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6f6e\u6c50\u74e6\u89e3\u4e8b\u4ef6(TDEs)\u4e2d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7TDE\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5916\u6d41\uff08\u8000\u6591\uff09\u76f8\u4e92\u78b0\u649e\u6216\u4e0e\u5468\u56f4\u6838\u4ecb\u8d28\u78b0\u649e\u6765\u4ea7\u751f\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684TDEs\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f90\u5c04\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6765\u81ea\u5728TDE\u5149\u5b66\u5cf0\u503c\u540e100-1000\u5929\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u6e29\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u5916\u6d41\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5916\u6d41\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u6709\u5173\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62dfTDE\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u8d28\u91cf\u5916\u6d41\uff08\u8000\u6591\uff09\u78b0\u649e\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u666f\uff1a\u8fde\u7eed\u76d8\u8000\u6591\u76f8\u4e92\u78b0\u649e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5916\u6d41\u4e0e\u5468\u56f4\u6838\u4ecb\u8d28\u78b0\u649e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u8000\u6591\u8d28\u91cf\u3001CNM\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u8000\u6591\u53d1\u5c04\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u78b0\u649e\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6fc0\u6ce2\u901f\u5ea6\u57280.05c-0.3c\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ea610^17 cm\uff0c\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4eae\u5ea6\u4e3a10^27-10^30 erg s^-1 Hz^-1\u7684\u660e\u4eae\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u518d\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2aTDEs\u7684\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u80fd\u8c31\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5916\u6d41\u6765\u81ea\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5916\u6d41\u80fd\u591f\u4e3aTDEs\u4e2d\u7684\u665a\u671f\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\u63d0\u4f9b\u80fd\u91cf\u3002"}}

Boos"], "title": "Aspherical Remnants of Triple and Quadruple Detonations in Binary White Dwarfs", "comment": "18 pages, 11 figures, in review at ApJ", "summary": "White dwarfs which explode by the double-detonation mechanism may have a binary white dwarf donor which is subsequently ignited by its collision with the ejecta. This results in the destruction of the donor via either the triple- or quadruple-detonation mechanism, adding significant mass to the resulting ejecta as well as modifying its structure and composition. We simulate the evolution of supernova remnants resulting from such detonations in a variety of binary progenitors and compare them against a double detonation with a surviving donor. Because of the time delay between the detonations of the two white dwarfs, high-velocity ejecta from the first explosion governs the first few centuries of remnant evolution, whereas at later times the dense core resulting from the donor detonation drives both the forward and reverse shocks to larger radii. The collision between the highest-velocity ejecta of the primary explosion and the donor carves a conical wake into the ejecta, which persists into the remnant phase regardless of whether or not the donor detonates. Our suite of simulated remnants are found to exhibit multiple distinguishing features of the explosion properties: a distinct X-ray morphology in the thermal emission and iron lines for triple detonations and smaller remnants with centrally-concentrated emission for double detonations. The remnants are also varied in their elemental abundances and distributions, particularly for lighter elements, but these have limited observational utility and are sensitive to the properties of the progenitor binary.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u91cd\u6216\u56db\u91cd\u5f15\u7206\u673a\u5236\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5f15\u7206\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u9057\u8ff9\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u6210\u5206\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u5f15\u7206\u673a\u5236\uff08\u53cc\u5f15\u7206\u3001\u4e09\u91cd\u5f15\u7206\u3001\u56db\u91cd\u5f15\u7206\uff09\u5bf9\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u4f9b\u4f53\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u4e0e\u55b7\u5c04\u7269\u78b0\u649e\u540e\u88ab\u5f15\u7206\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u53cc\u661f\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6b64\u7c7b\u5f15\u7206\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f9b\u4f53\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u5e78\u5b58\u7684\u53cc\u5f15\u7206\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u91cd\u5f15\u7206\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u72ec\u7279\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u94c1\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u53cc\u5f15\u7206\u5219\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5c0f\u4e14\u4e2d\u5fc3\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u9057\u8ff9\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u5f15\u7206\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5143\u7d20\u4e30\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8f7b\u5143\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u5f15\u7206\u673a\u5236\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u5143\u7d20\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u53cc\u661f\u7279\u6027\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u9650\u3002"}}

In the late stages of stellar evolution, intense shell burning can cause distinct convective regions to merge, fundamentally restructuring the stellar interior. Although such phenomena are difficult to observe directly, the observation of ``Mg-rich'' supernova remnants (SNRs) has recently emerged as a potential signature of these events. In this study, we reanalyze X-ray observations of J0550--6823, a SNR in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and a new candidate Mg-rich SNR. Our spectral analysis confirms a low Ne/Mg mass ratio of $\\approx$1, and its classification as Mg-rich. By comparing the observational results with pre-supernova models, we suggest that the progenitor of J0550-6823 likely had an extended convective shell that reduces the Ne/Mg ratio prior to its explosion. Furthermore, we observe that $\\sim$2--3 Mg-rich SNRs exist in the LMC, suggesting that $\\lesssim$10--40\\% of massive stars in the LMC may have had an extended convective shell, similar to what we observed in J0550-6823.

We performed X-ray monitoring of the source with NICER and AstroSat near the peak of the event. Our primary objective is to investigate the energy and luminosity dependence of the pulsed emission, characterize the spin evolution, and study the broadband X-ray spectral properties of RX J0520.5-6932 during the outburst. The AstroSat/LAXPC and NICER light curves reveal pronounced short-duration flaring activity lasting ~400-700 s, with enhancements by a factor of ~2. The pulse profile exhibits a strong dependence on both energy and intensity, evolving from a simple single-peaked structure at low energies to complex multi-peaked shapes at intermediate energies, and reverting to simpler morphologies at higher energies. Pulse profiles during the flares differ significantly from those in the persistent state, indicating changes in the pulsed beam pattern with a change in the intensity on a short timescale. Broadband spectral analysis reveals a soft excess and an emission feature at ~1 keV, likely arising from reprocessed emission in the accretion disc and fluorescence from Ne K and Fe L ions. Continuous NICER monitoring over nearly one orbital cycle enabled us to track spin evolution with accretion-driven spin-up and spectral variability in the soft X-ray band. Additionally, a declining spin-up rate is observed during the outburst, likely due to a gradual reduction in mass accretion rate. Our results provide a comprehensive view of the complex accretion dynamics in RX J0520.5-6932 during its 2024 outburst. The strong variability in pulse shape and spin behaviour highlights rapid changes in the accretion geometry and torque as a function of accretion rate.

In this paper, we compare the experimental results on K-$\u03b2$ X-ray Ar spectra with modelling using the time-dependent version of the Cloudy astrophysical code. The results indicate that photoionized laboratory plasmas can be successfully modelled with codes such as Cloudy that have been developed for application to astrophysical sources.

According to the JJEM, additional weaker pairs of jets may also have participated in the explosion. The jets' axis from the ear to the nozzle coincides with the axis of the presently active pulsar jets, which is the pulsar spin axis. The jets of this pair were the last that the newly born neutron star launched during the explosion, and the accretion disk that launched these jets spun up the neutron star in the same direction as the jets. The identification of a point-symmetric morphology in SNR G11.2-0.3 strengthens the claim that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9SNR G11.2-0.3\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u70b9\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u7531\u4e09\u5bf9\u76f8\u53cd\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6296\u52a8\u55b7\u6d41\u7206\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u662f\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7206\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76SNR G11.2-0.3\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6296\u52a8\u55b7\u6d41\u7206\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7206\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u9057\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u70b9\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u5bf9\u76f8\u53cd\u73af\u3001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u4e24\u4fa7\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u55b7\u5c04\u7269\u5e26\u4ee5\u53ca\u8033-\u55b7\u5634\u5bf9\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u7206\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u5bf9\u80fd\u91cf\u55b7\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u5bf9\u660e\u663e\u7684\u70b9\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8033-\u55b7\u5634\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u55b7\u6d41\u8f74\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u55b7\u6d41\u8f74\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u662f\u65b0\u751f\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5728\u7206\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5bf9\u55b7\u6d41\u3002", "conclusion": "SNR G11.2-0.3\u4e2d\u70b9\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e86\u6296\u52a8\u55b7\u6d41\u7206\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u662f\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u4e3b\u8981\u7206\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e3b\u5f20\u3002"}}

In this work, we analyze MBH mergers, their GW signals and detectability, as well as their population properties, using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation - NINJA Simulation Suite. We discuss the effect of resolution and finite volume on the black hole mass function (BHMF), which in turn limits the mergers associated with low mass black holes, $M_{BH} \\lesssim 10^{6.5} M_\\odot$. We find the upper limit on the total mass of the MBH binaries detectable by LISA to be $\\sim 10^{8.4} M_\\odot$. We also find that adding time delays pertaining to dissipative processes like dynamical friction and stellar hardening during the final stages of the inspiral for which the simulation lacks sufficient resolution to model, considerably shifts the peak of redshift distribution of detectable binaries from $z\\sim0.5$ to $z\\sim0.1$. Time delays reduce the number of detectable GW events but on the other hand their signal-to-noise is increased. From the observational point of view, we find a strong correlation between the SFR and $L_{\\rm bol}$ at high redshifts for the detectable LISA binaries. This may prove to be a future application in the coincident observation of MBH binaries by GW and electromagnetic observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528NINJA\u5b87\u5b99\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u53ca\u5176\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0cLISA\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u53cc\u661f\u603b\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u9650\u4e3a10^8.4\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u53cc\u661f\u7684\u7ea2\u79fb\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u5b87\u5b99\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u661f\u7cfb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528NINJA\u5b87\u5b99\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5957\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u3001\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u6709\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6469\u64e6\u548c\u6052\u661f\u786c\u5316\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9M_BH\u227210^6.5\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\uff1bLISA\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u53cc\u661f\u603b\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u9650\u4e3a~10^8.4\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5c06\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u53cc\u661f\u7ea2\u79fb\u5206\u5e03\u5cf0\u503c\u4ecez~0.5\u79fb\u81f3z~0.1\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u4e0b\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u4e0eL_bol\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u91cf\u4f46\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff0c\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u4e0eL_bol\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u548c\u7535\u78c1\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u89c2\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}
