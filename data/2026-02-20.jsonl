We validate our algorithm on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset, successfully detecting all 15 injected MBHBs: 14 of them hours-to-weeks before merger, while one is only detected after the binary coalescence. The algorithm yields chirp mass relative errors below $3\\%$ for high-SNR sources and coalescence time uncertainties of up to a few hours. With a computational cost of less than a second to process a 10-day data segment on single core, our approach is suitable for generating real-time alerts, trigger protected observational periods, and provide informative priors for Bayesian parameter estimation."}

Because the Pt/Cr-Ne lamps used for the wavecals have been fading (especially at the shortest wavelengths), some changes in the default lamp and/or exposure time have been implemented in recent years to maintain accurate calibrations. To assess whether additional changes might be appropriate, we examine the distribution of the SHIFTA1, SHIFTA2 values derived from the wavecals (the x and y offsets of the spectral image on the detector), we re-visit the wavelength-dependent fading of the lamps, and we perform simulations to estimate the exposure times that would be needed to obtain accurate SHIFTA values. While the current wavecals do appear to yield reasonable SHIFTA, increases in the default exposure times for some of the shortest-wavelength settings would help to ensure reliable wavelength zero points as the lamps continue to fade."}

The analysis enables to obtain the degree of randomness of the white noise for various pulsars and to reveal its inhomogeneity, i.e. pulsars with low and high randomness of the white noise. The time-dependence of the randomness in the white noise is also studied, indicating the existence of non-stationary physical processes influencing the pulsar timing. The KSP thus is acting as an indicator for the degree of the agreement between the observations and the timing models and as a test in revealing the contribution of various physical processes in the stochastic background signal."}

We explore several possible explanations for the observed $\\dot{P}$, including stable mass-transfer driven by impulsive mass loss events in an EMRI, velocity kicks at pericenter due to tidal interactions with the SMBH, apparent period changes due either to general relativistic precession effects in an EMRI or light travel-time delays in a hierarchical SMBH binary, and mass-transfer variations in a thermal/viscous disk instability model. We find that none of the considered models provides a complete explanation for the data, motivating further work on physical explanations for positive period derivatives in QPEs."}

Using the archival data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) $γ$-ray observatory, we perform a coincidence search for gamma rays and neutrinos using a Bayesian Block algorithm with the public IceCube alerts from IceCat-1, along with additional alerts issued later. In this work, we consider 368 alerts, up to July 8, 2025, that are within HAWC's field of view.

We measure the spectral properties, power spectral densities (PSDs), fractional variability amplitudes, and energy dependence of the variability for 18 TDEs spanning 54 observations, of which 27 occur in thermal disk-dominated states and 27 show a nonthermal hard X-ray corona. Compared to pure thermal sources, we find TDEs with coronae are more X-ray variable and show steeper PSDs indicating longer correlation timescales. This state-transition behavior is qualitatively similar to X-ray binaries, which show higher fractional variability in the hard state than in the soft state. However, newborn TDE coronae show systematically flatter PSDs and softer energy spectra than their long-lived AGN counterparts. We also show that the variability amplitude of thermal TDEs increases with photon energy, consistent with variations sourced by local temperature fluctuations and exponentially enhanced in the Wien tail. Our work demonstrates that combining spectral and timing properties of X-ray TDEs can probe the microphysics of newly formed accretion flows around supermassive black holes, and that the coronae formed in TDEs fundamentally differ from those in AGN."}

The model enables space-resolved tomography of the pulsar magnetosphere, yielding a radial plasma density profile of $n_{e}\\propto r^{-3}$, which agrees with theoretical insights. We predict the zebra pattern trend to change at a higher frequency when the ray separation becomes smaller than the pulsar size. This frequency is predicted to be in the range between 42 GHz and 650 GHz, which is within the reach of existing facilities like ALMA and SMA. These observations hold significant importance and would contribute to our understanding of the magnetosphere.

In total, 12 potential candidates have been identified while none of them are likely related to S250206dm. This non-detection provides the most stringent constraint to date on any associated kilonova. Crucially, an AT 2017gfo-like event at 269 Mpc can be excluded by WFST observations alone. Based on ejecta mass limits, a neutron star-black hole with a large mass ratio (Q >= 3.2) is disfavored. This optical-derived constraint on the mass ratio reaches, for the first time, a precision comparable to that inferred from the GW signal.

The discovery magnitude of the 16 WFST-PS early-phase SNe is at least 3 mag fainter than their peak brightness. A large scatter of color indices is found in approximately the first 10 days of supernova explosions, indicating diverse photometric behaviors in the early phase. Three EExSNe Ia show relatively brighter peak luminosities and longer rise time compared to those of non-EExSNe Ia. The results indicate that current theoretical models require further refinement to fully capture the early photometric evolution of SNe Ia. Based on the initial high-cadence ugr-band data from the WFST-PS survey, we emphasize that early near-ultraviolet (NUV) observations are indispensable for placing tight constraints on the explosion mechanisms and progenitor systems of SNe Ia."}

Its light curve is characterized by a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B = -18.49 \\pm 0.03$ mag and a decline rate of $Δm_{15}(B) = 1.53 \\pm 0.36$ mag, placing the object on the $Δm_{15}(B)$--$M_B$ diagram in the transition region between normal and subluminous SNe Ia. Furthermore, the early-color evolution and host galaxy environment of SN 2024aedt underscore its transitional nature, sharing properties with both normal and 91bg-like SNe Ia.

A comparison with theoretical models suggests that the evolutionary trend can be broadly explained by both delayed-detonation (DDT) and double-detonation (DDet) scenarios while possible early-excess emissions predicted by DDet cannot be identified given the limited detections soon after the SN explosion. Although the overall spectral evolution of SN 2024aedt is similar to that of other transitional SNe Ia, the spectroscopic comparison reveals diversity in the early-phase blue-end features, which becomes more homogeneous at later phases. The result indicates the importance of early-time observations in understanding the origin of SN Ia diversity."}

Using the decade-long multi-band observations from the Swift observatory, we capture a clear spectral state transition analogous to those seen in X-ray binaries but seldom observed in a single AGN. We track a complete AGN state transition in real time, as the source evolves from a faint, hard X-ray state to a bright, UV- and soft X-ray dominated phase. The X-ray loudness parameter $α_{ox}$ follows a pronounced 'V'-shaped dependence on Eddington ratio $λ_{Edd}$, with a break at $λ_{Edd}$ = 0.021 +/- 0.008, coinciding with thresholds identified in population studies of changing-look quasars and X-ray binaries. Across this transition, Mkn 590 evolves through distinct accretion regimes in the Hardness Intensity Diagrams (HID): faint, flaring, transitional, and bright, on a timescale of $\\sim$10 years, which is well below classical viscous timescales for a geometrically thin disk but in agreement with the propagation of thermal wavefronts in the inner disk. When placed on the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, the source broadly follows the expected radio/X-ray mass scaling, though with a 70% flatter slope, pointing towards a persistent coronal-jet coupling even in radiatively efficient states. Together, our results establish Mkn 590 as a rare, time-resolved case of AGN state transitions and offer compelling evidence for scale-invariant accretion physics across the black hole mass spectrum."}
