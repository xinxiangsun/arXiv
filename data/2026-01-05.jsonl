In particular, unintended electromagnetic radiation emitted by satellite electronics exhibits strong temporal variability and weak spectral regularity, limiting the effectiveness of conventional mitigation techniques that rely on long term averaging or multi epoch observations. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits of low rank interference mitigation in the single epoch regime, where only a single time frequency snapshot is available. We formulate satellite induced interference as a structured but non stationary component superposed on astrophysical signals and thermal noise, and analyze the conditions under which low rank decomposition can successfully suppress interference while preserving underlying astronomical information. Through controlled simulations and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that aggressive rank truncation can lead to substantial signal distortion, particularly for diffuse or low signal to noise astrophysical features. We quantify this trade off using preservation and suppression metrics, and show that beyond a critical interference strength, low rank methods inevitably induce irreversible information loss. Our results clarify the operational boundaries of low rank approaches for next generation radio observations and highlight the need for interference aware, data driven mitigation strategies tailored to the single epoch regime."}

We present a light-tight shield for skipper-CCDs to suppress optical backgrounds while preserving X-ray detection efficiency. We deposited thin aluminum layers on the CCD surface using an e-beam evaporator and evaluated their blinding performance across wavelengths from 650 to 1000 nm using a monochromator, as well as the X-ray transmission using an $^{55}$Fe source. We find that 50 and 100\\,nm layers provide >99.6\\% light suppression, with no efficiency loss for 5.9 and 6.4\\,keV X-rays.

LoRA is an established technique for large language models that adds adapter networks to adjust model weights and biases to efficiently fine-tune large base models without retraining. We train a base model using a photometric redshift ground truth dataset, which contains broad galaxy types but is less accurate. We then fine-tune using LoRA on a spectroscopic redshift ground truth dataset. These redshifts are more accurate but limited to bright galaxies and take orders of magnitude more time to obtain, so are less available for large surveys. Ideally, the combination of the two datasets would yield more accurate models that generalize well. The LoRA model performs better than a traditional transfer learning method, with $\\sim2.5\\times$ less bias and $\\sim$2.2$\\times$ less scatter. Retraining the model on a combined dataset yields a model that generalizes better than LoRA but at a cost of greater computation time. Our work shows that LoRA is useful for fine-tuning regression models in astrophysics by providing a middle ground between full retraining and no retraining. LoRA shows potential in allowing us to leverage existing pretrained astrophysical models, especially for data sparse tasks."}

As such, it makes a formidable case study to better understand astrophysical processes. Solar flares are in particular very interesting as they are linked to coronal mass ejections as well as magnetic field reconnection sites in the solar atmosphere. Flares can therefore provide insightful information on the physical processes at play on their production sites, but also on the emission and acceleration of energetic charged particles towards our planet, making it a formidable forecasting tool for space weather. While solar flares are critical to understanding magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration, their hard X-ray polarization -- key to distinguishing between competing theoretical models -- remains poorly constrained by existing observations. To address this, we present the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP), a mission under development to perform solar flare polarimetry in the 25-100 keV energy range. CUSP consists of a 6U-XL platform hosting a dual-phase Compton polarimeter. The polarimeter is made of a central assembly of four 4x4 arrays of plastic scintillators, each coupled to multi-anode photomultiplier tubes, surrounded by four strips of eight elongated GAGG scintillator bars coupled to avalanche photodiodes. Both types of sensors from Hamamatsu are respectively read out by the MAROC-3A and SKIROC-2A ASICs from Weeroc. In this manuscript, we present the preliminary spectral performances of single plastic and GAGG channels measured in the laboratory using development boards of the ASICs foreseen for the flight model."}

The difficulty increases when solving the accretion process and propagation of the outflows, as it requires covering distances from the black hole horizon to beyond the progenitor star. General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations provide a convenient framework to study high-luminosity jets, where magnetic flux plays an important role in the process of jet launching from the central engine. To follow the propagation of the jet through and beyond its progenitor environment, we use multi-scale simulations (i.e., AMR-based).

In this paper, we propose ASCNet, an innovative model specifically designed for classifying nighttime ASC images collected at the Muztagh-ata site from 2022 March to 2024 June. ASCNet integrates ResNet34 with an ASCModule, which employs Depthwise Dilated Convolution and embeds lightweight Squeeze-and-Excitation attention within its branches to extract fine-grained texture information from the luminance channel. The data set is partitioned by category, with 70% of images assigned to the training set and 30% to the test set. The model's performance is assessed by comparing its predictions on the test set with manually annotated labels, yielding a consistency rate of 92.7%. All evaluation metrics of ASCNet are as follows: Accuracy 92.66%, Precision 83.26%, Recall 84.25%, and F1-Score 83.67%, and both ablation and comparative experiments demonstrate significant superiority over other models. A confusion matrix is utilized to analyze the differences between manual classification and model classification. The statistical results demonstrate the model's excellent classification performance and its robust generalization ability, illustrating that ASCNet has potential for application in future astronomical image classifications."}

General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models of M87* and its accretion disk predict that the amplitude and location of the ring's peak brightness asymmetry should fluctuate due to turbulence in the source plasma. We compare the observed distribution of brightness asymmetry amplitudes to the simulated distribution in GRMHD models, across varying black hole spin $a_{*}$. We show that, for strongly magnetized (MAD) models, three epochs of EHT data marginally disfavor $|a_{*}| \\lesssim 0.2$. This is consistent with the Blandford-Znajek model for M87's jet, which predicts that M87* should have nonzero spin. We show quantitatively how future observations could improve spin constraints, and discuss how improved spin constraints could distinguish between differing jet-launching mechanisms and black hole growth scenarios."}

Fast radio bursts are short and intense pulses of coherent radio emission. Their large dispersion measures support an extragalactic origin. While their exact origin still remains elusive, a substantial number of models associates them with strong magnetic field and high-energy relativistic plasma found in the vicinity of magnetars. There is growing evidence that some fast radio bursts are associated to flare-type events from magnetars. We aim to provide a set of configurations describing a relativistic, spherical, mass-loaded, magnetic explosion. We proceed by solving the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, for a system that expands while maintaining its internal equilibrium. We employ a semi-analytical approach for the solution of the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. We assume self-similarity in time and radius, axial symmetry, and separation of variables. There exists a dichotomy of solutions that correspond to higher and lower density and thermal pressure compared to the external one. The ratio of the poloidal to toroidal field and the inclusion of pressure and mass density affect the expansion velocity. The classes of these solutions can be applied to magnetar giant flares and fast radio bursts. The ones corresponding to overdensities and higher pressure can be associated to magnetar flares, whereas the ones corresponding to underdensities can be relevant to fast radio bursts corresponding to magnetically dominated events with low mass loading."}

We show that a radiatively compact turbulent corona generates extended nonthermal ion distributions, while producing X-ray spectra consistent with observations. As an example, we demonstrate excellent agreement with observed X-ray spectra of NGC 4151. The predicted emission spectra feature an MeV tail, which can be studied with future MeV-band instruments. The MeV tail is shaped by nonthermal electrons accelerated at turbulent current sheets. We also find that the corona regulates itself into a two-temperature state, with ions much hotter than electrons. The ions carry away roughly 60% to 70% of the dissipated power, and their energization is driven by a combination of shocks and reconnecting current sheets, embedded into the turbulent flow."}

We develop an analytic model of line emission, demonstrating that relativistic beaming results in a broadened, power-law spectral feature with photon index -1. We then perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations incorporating electron-positron pair production, annihilation, and Compton scattering. The dependence of the emergent spectrum on the baryon loading is also examined, showing that a baryon-poor fireball is more favorable for the detection of MeV gamma rays. We further assess the detectability of the line component. The simulation results indicate that a power-law MeV component from the initial spike of a Galactic MGFs could be observed with current instruments, such as Fermi/GBM, and will be well within the reach of upcoming MeV gamma-ray satellites, which are expected to detect O(100) photons from such events."}

Previous studies support consistency with the leptonic modeling of the halo, which attributes its origin to slow diffusion in the interstellar medium. In this work, we investigated the possibility of proton-proton channel as the origin of these photons. To explain the observed gamma rays with energy $\\sim 4$ TeV by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) telescope till 200 TeV by the LHAASO observatory, one requires the CR proton luminosity to be $η_p\\sim 0.1$ of the pulsar PSR J0622+3749 spin-down luminosity. In this case, we have considered the protons propagating in a one-zone superdiffusion environment, specifically $α= 1$ in a cloud of gas density 1 per cm$^{3}$."}

We find that all systems suppress accretion onto the binary when the gas is relatively cold. CBRs display weak variability above the binary orbital frequency $Ω_b$ and a dominant, robust spectral peak at $\\sim0.1Ω_b$ (half the fiducial lump frequency of $\\sim0.2Ω_b$). Smaller rings relax into disks with enhanced gas eccentricity up to $e\\simeq 0.3$. We consider the possibility that inefficiently-accreting, intermediate-mass ($\\sim10^4 M_\\odot$) black hole binaries may be sources of quasi-periodic eruptions when rejected streams shock the cavity wall and radiate in the UV or soft X-ray. We discuss the implications of eccentric disks evolved from CBRs for quasar light curves and asymmetric, time-variable double-peaked line emission from disks in galactic nuclei. If binaries drive asymmetry in accretion disk line profiles, our study suggests that the progenitor CBR must have been very compact."}

NGC 1365 is known for rapid transitions between Compton-thick and Compton-thin states, along with strong absorption from a highly ionized wind. During our observations, the source is found in a persistent low-flux state, characterized by a decrease in hard-X-ray luminosity and significant line-of-sight obscuration. In this state, XRISM/Resolve reveals clear Fe\\,\\textsc{xxv} and Fe\\,\\textsc{xxvi} absorption lines together with, for the first time in this source, corresponding emission lines. These features may arise either from reemission from a photoionized wind (P Cygni profile) or from collisionally ionized gas associated with outflow-driven shocks in the interstellar medium. We estimate the wind launch radius to be approximately $10^{16}~\\mathrm{cm}$ ($\\sim 10^4 R_{\\mathrm{g}}$), consistent with the location of the X-ray broad-line region. We also resolve a broadened Fe K$α$ line by $σ\\sim 1300$ km s$^{-1}$ placing it at similar scales to the wind, consistent with radii inferred from disk-broadening models and the variability of the Fe K$α$ broad line. The similarity of the Fe K$α$ profile to the H$β$ wing and broad Pa$α$ width indicates that the X-ray-emitting region is likely cospatial with the optical/IR broad-line region and originates from the same gas."}
