The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer\n(GOTO), with its wide field of view, dual-site coverage, and robotic\nrapid-response capability, bridges this gap by rapidly identifying and\nlocalising afterglows from alerts issued by space-based facilities including\nFermi, SVOM, Swift, and the EP, providing early optical positions for\ncoordinated multi-wavelength follow-up. In this paper, we present optical\nafterglow localisation and multi-band follow-up of seven Fermi/GBM and MAXI/GSC\ntriggered long GRBs (240122A, 240225B, 240619A, 240910A, 240916A, 241002B, and\n241228B) discovered by GOTO in 2024. Spectroscopy for six GRBs (no\nspectroscopic data for GRB 241002B) with VLT/X-shooter and GTC/OSIRIS yields\nprecise redshifts spanning $z\\approx0.40-$3.16 and absorption-line diagnostics\nof host and intervening systems. Radio detections for four events confirm the\npresence of long-lived synchrotron emission. Prompt-emission analysis with\nFermi and MAXI data reveals a spectrally hard population, with two bursts lying\n$>3\\sigma$ above the Amati relation. Although their optical afterglows resemble\nthose of typical long GRBs, the prompt spectra are consistently harder than the\nlong-GRB average. Consistent modelling of six GOTO-discovered GRB afterglows\nyields jet half-opening angles of a few degrees and beaming-corrected kinetic\nenergies ($E_{jet}\\sim10^{51-52}$) erg, consistent with the canonical long-GRB\npopulation. These findings suggest that optical discovery of poorly localised\nGRBs may be subject to observational biases favouring luminous events with high\nspectral peak energy, while also providing insight into jet microphysics and\ncentral engine diversity."}

Measuring the excited fundamental modes of neutron\nstars in gravitational-wave signals offers a promising solution, as these modes\nencode information about stellar composition, structure, and dynamics.

A\nslab corona may not explain the hard state observations of X-ray binaries\n(XRBs). We incorporate energy feedback to the accretion disk resulting from\nillumination by an extended corona, and vice versa. The interaction between\nthese two components allows for the possibility of finding an energetically\nself-consistent equilibrium solution for a given disk-corona system. We have\nupgraded the existing Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, MONK, to incorporate\nthe interaction between the disk and the extended corona within the general\nrelativistic framework. We introduce an albedo parameter to specify the\nfraction of the incident flux that is reflected by the disk, while the\nremainder is absorbed and added to the intrinsic dissipation. Reflection is\nmodeled assuming a semi-infinite electron atmosphere. We find global\nequilibrium solutions by iterating interaction between disk and extended slab\ncorona. A higher black hole spin, higher coronal temperature, and higher albedo\nall lead to harder spectra. For typical coronal temperatures and disk albedo,\nthe lowest achievable photon index with a static slab corona fully covering the\ndisk is approximately 1.7-1.8. With the upgraded version of MONK, we are now\nable to achieve global energy equilibrium for a given disk-corona system. This\napproach holds significant potential for constraining the coronal geometry\nusing not only the observed flux but also polarization. A static slab does not\nappear to be a favorable coronal geometry for the hard state of XRBs, even when\nglobal energy balance is taken into account. In future work, we will explore\ntruncated disk geometries and outflowing coronae as potential alternatives.\n(shortened)"}

HMXBs are expected to have\nexperienced a supernova in their evolution. The impulsive kick associated with\nthis event should affect the space velocity of the system in a way that depends\non the nature and state of the progenitor binary. Here, we test whether the\ndifferent evolutionary histories of HMXBs have left a detectable imprint on\ntheir peculiar velocities ($V_{\\rm pec}$). Using data from Gaia Data Release 3\n(Gaia DR3), we first calculate the $V_{\\rm pec}$ values for 63 well-known HMXBs\nhosting a black hole or neutron star and estimate the associated uncertainties\nvia Monte Carlo re-sampling. We then analyse their distribution and check for\ndifferences between classes. Overall, $V_{\\rm pec}$ estimates extend up to 100\nkm s$^{-1}$, but with Be/X-ray binaries (BeXRBs) favouring $V_{\\rm pec}$\n$\\lesssim 40$ km s$^{-1}$ and supergiant X-ray binaries (SgXRBs) favouring\n$V_{\\rm pec}$ $\\gtrsim 40$ km s$^{-1}$.

Tests with binary population\nsynthesis demonstrate that SgXRBs typically have shorter orbital periods and\nhigher fractional mass loss than BeXRBs at supernova. We argue that the\nmagnitude of $V_{\\rm pec}$ could be used as a complementary feature to\ndistinguish between Be and supergiant systems. These findings extend previous\ninferences based on two-dimensional kinematics from Hipparcos, and may be\nexplained by the differing nature of the respective progenitors systems between\nthe source classes at the instant of supernova."}

Studying accretion and feedback together\nenables estimates of matter and energy input/output around accreting BHs. We\nfocus on the extended jet structures of the BH-XRB GRS1758-258. First seen in\nVLA data, these parsec-scale jets arise from jet-ISM interaction and show a\nZ-shaped morphology. Using the MeerKAT telescope we observed GRS1758-258 in\nL-band for a total exposure of 7 hr. Applying a calorimetry-based method\ndeveloped for AGN and later used for XRBs, we estimated the properties of the\njets and of the surrounding ISM. We detect a jet and counter-jet terminating in\nbow-shocks. Within the northern jet lobe we identify synchrotron and\nbremsstrahlung emission, while the southern lobe is dominated by thermal\nemission. We measure ISM densities between 10-40 cm-3 across both jets,\nslightly lower in the northern region. The estimated ages of the two lobes\nrange from 6-51 kyr. The time-averaged jet power lies between 4.4x10^33 and\n3.3x10^36 erg/s, with differences between north and south likely due to\ndifferent local ISM conditions. Comparing new MeerKAT with archival VLA data,\nwe measured a proper motion of 130 mas/yr in a portion of the northern jet.\nJet-ISM interaction structures on both sides of GRS1758-258 reveal different\nISM properties. The comparison between these structures and those from other\nXRBs suggests that the lobes in GRS1758-258 are younger and may result from\ndifferent jet activity phases.

The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during\nthe late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong\nshocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured\naccretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find\nthat the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in\ntime, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated\nin both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but\njumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau.

We investigate the effectiveness of\nspin-induced multipole moments (SIQM) and tidal deformability measurements in\ndistinguishing lower mass-gap black hole (BH) binaries from non-BH binaries\nwith different mass and spin configurations. We perform model-agnostic tests on\nbinary BH (BBH) simulations using full Bayesian inference, evaluating the\nindependent and joint measurability of SIQM and tidal parameters across the\nparameter space. We extend the analysis to simulations of self-interacting\nspinning boson stars, using synthetic signals that exhibit (a) both SIQM and\ntidal effects and (b) each effect individually. For case (a), recovery is\nperformed using (i) a BBH model, (ii) a model incorporating both SIQM and tidal\neffects, and (iii) models including either SIQM or tidal effects. For case (b),\nwe employ (i) a BBH model and (ii) models incorporating either SIQM or tidal\neffects, consistent with the injection. Simulations employ TaylorF2 waveform\nmodel and consider binaries in the low mass gap with varying spin magnitudes.\nWe find that employing an incorrect model to analyze the signal can lead to\nbiases in parameter inference.
