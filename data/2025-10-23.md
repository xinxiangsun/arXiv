TL;DR: 本文提出在NASA的宜居世界天文台(HWO)上部署专用天体测量仪器的概念，该仪器能实现20毫角秒的点扩散函数精度，通过探测器校准系统和稳定望远镜设计，达到亚微角秒级精度，用于探测附近类太阳恒星宜居带的地球质量系外行星和研究暗物质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前天体测量任务如Gaia虽然精确，但探测附近宜居带类地行星和研究暗物质在星系环境中的影响需要亚微角秒级精度，现有技术难以满足这些科学目标。

Method: 在HWO上部署专用天体测量仪器，采用大型CMOS焦平面和拼接像素阵列实现大视场，使用干涉激光条纹的探测器校准系统校准像素位置，通过差分天体测量和稳定望远镜的定点观测实现长时间积分。

Result: 该仪器能产生衍射极限的大视场图像，PSF精度达20毫角秒，通过探测器校准和稳定观测可达到亚微角秒级精度，能够探测10秒差距内类太阳恒星宜居带的地球质量行星轨道，并显著改进对重暗物质粒子自相互作用截面和超高质量暗物质粒子质量的约束。

Conclusion: HWO上的专用天体测量仪器结合直接成像能力，将革命性地推进系外行星探测和暗物质研究，实现亚微角秒级天体测量精度，为寻找宜居世界和理解暗物质性质提供关键工具。

Abstract: Astrometry, one of the oldest branches of astronomy, has been revolutionized
by missions like Hipparcos and especially Gaia, which mapped billions of stars
with extraordinary precision. However, challenges such as detecting Earth-like
exoplanets in nearby habitable zones and probing the influence of dark matter
in galactic environments require sub-microarcsecond accuracy. With a 6--8 meter
large-aperture telescope operating across at visible wavelengths, the Habitable
Worlds Observatory by NASA can combine astrometry and direct imaging to detect
rocky exoplanets within 10 parsecs and study their atmospheres. We consider
here the scientific requirements and present a concept for a dedicated
astrometric instrument on HWO. It is capable to produce diffraction-limited
images of large fields, achieving a point-spread function (PSF) precision of 20
milliarcseconds. Equipped with a detector calibration system, HWO can perform
high precision astrometry, and, detect and measure the orbit of Earth-mass
planets in the habitable zone of Nearby Solar-type stars. HWO can dramatically
improve current constraints on the self- interaction cross-section of heavy
dark matter particles (WIMPs) and on the masses of ultra-high dark matter
particles, through the study of stellar motions in galactic environments. The
visible channel of the instrument features a large CMOS-based focal plane with
stitched pixel arrays, enabling a large field of view. The ``Detector
Calibration Unit'' system uses interferometric laser fringes to calibrate pixel
positions. Using differential astrometry and pointed observations with a stable
telescope design enables extended integration times, enhancing sensitivity to
sub-microarcsecond precision for detecting exoplanets and studying dark matter
through stellar motion.

### [2] [Modeling atmospheric phase corruptions in high-frequency VLBI using Gaussian processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19071)
*Uri Rolls,Dominic W. Pesce,Paul Tiede,Lindy Blackburn,Iniyan Natarajan,Sheperd S. Doeleman*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于高斯过程的相位校准方法，用于处理事件视界望远镜在高频VLBI观测中由大气水汽变化引起的相位波动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件视界望远镜在高频VLBI观测中面临的大气水汽引起的快速相位波动问题，这些波动限制了相干积分时间和可达到的灵敏度。

Method: 采用高斯过程描述各台站的相位误差时间演化，结合源结构参数化，并使用卡尔曼滤波算法对相位误差进行数值边缘化处理。

Result: 在3C 279的实际EHT观测数据上验证了该方法，证明其校准结果与EHT合作组确定的结果一致。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理高频VLBI观测中的相位校准问题，无需指定参考台站，并可扩展到处理频率相关的相位行为。

Abstract: Using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations at
(sub)millimeter wavelengths, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) currently
achieves the finest angular resolution of any astronomical facility, necessary
for imaging the horizon-scale structure around supermassive black holes. A
significant calibration challenge for high-frequency VLBI stems from rapid
variations in the atmospheric water vapor content above each telescope in the
array, which induce corresponding fluctuations in the phase of the correlated
signal that limit the coherent integration time and thus the achievable
sensitivity. In this paper, we introduce a model that describes station-based
phase corruptions jointly with a parameterization for the source structure. We
adopt a Gaussian Process (GP) prescription for the time evolution of these
phase corruptions, which provides sufficient flexibility to capture even highly
erratic phase behavior. The use of GPs permits the application of a Kalman
filtering algorithm for numerical marginalization of these phase corruptions,
which permits efficient exploration of the remaining parameter space. Our model
also removes the need to specify an arbitrary ``reference station'' during
calibration, instead establishing a global phase zeropoint by enforcing the GPs
at all stations to have fixed mean and finite variance. We validate our method
using a real EHT observation of the blazar 3C 279, demonstrating that our
approach yields calibration solutions that are consistent with those determined
by the EHT Collaboration. The model presented here can be straightforwardly
extended to incorporate frequency-dependent phase behavior, such as is relevant
for the frequency phase transfer calibration technique.

### [3] [Segmentation and Celestial Mapping of Unobservable Regions in Nighttime All-sky Images for the Mephisto Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19335)

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的夜间天空图像分割框架，通过像素级掩码精确识别云层和月光影响区域，并映射到天球坐标，实现实时云感知观测调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统红外传感或光度消光方法只能提供粗略的非空间天空清晰度估计，无法满足实时决策需求，导致观测时间浪费和望远镜指向云层或月光影响区域的数据污染。

Method: 使用深度学习分割框架处理全天图像，生成像素级不可观测区域掩码，通过手动标注的夜间图像数据集训练，并利用天顶等积投影将分割结果映射到天球坐标。

Result: 实现了对云层和月光影响区域的精确检测，能够无缝集成到观测控制系统，为实时云感知调度提供支持。

Conclusion: 该框架虽然为Mephisto望远镜开发，但具有通用性，可应用于其他配备全天监控的广域机器人天文台。

Abstract: Accurate identification of unobservable regions in nighttime is essential for
autonomous scheduling and data quality control in observations.Traditional
methods-such as infrared sensing or photometric extinction-provide only
coarse,non-spatial estimates of sky clarity,making them insufficient for
real-time decision-making.This not only wastes observing time but also
introduces contamination when telescopes are directed toward cloud-covered or
moonlight-affected regions.To address these limitations,we propose a deep
learning-based segmentation framework that provides pixel-level masks of
unobservable areas using all-sky images.Supported by a manually annotated
dataset of nighttime images,our method enables precise detection of cloud- and
moonlight-affected regions.The segmentation results are further mapped to
celestial coordinates through Zenithal Equal-Area projection,allowing seamless
integration with observation control systems (OCS) for real-time cloud-aware
scheduling.While developed for the Mephisto telescope,the framework is
generalizable and applicable to other wide-field robotic observatories equipped
with all-sky monitoring.

### [4] [Advances in detector response and background modelling in the ANAIS-112 experiment for annual modulation and other rare event searches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19469)
*Tamara Pardo Yanguas*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: ANAIS-112实验使用112.5kg NaI(Tl)闪烁体在Canfranc地下实验室运行，旨在独立验证DAMA/LIBRA的暗物质信号。该论文通过数据分析和Geant4模拟，重点研究核反冲的闪烁淬灭因子，改进背景模型，并进行新物理搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 独立验证DAMA/LIBRA实验报告的暗物质信号，使用相同的NaI靶材，解决闪烁淬灭因子的系统不确定性，确保与其他实验的可靠比较。

Method: 使用Geant4模拟进行中子校准，比较校准数据与模拟结果；通过多参数拟合改进背景模型；重新分析年度调制信号；搜索太阳轴子；在COSINUS实验中进行背景建模。

Result: 模拟显示Geant4在某些衰变过程和截面计算中存在缺陷；模拟对淬灭因子高度敏感，支持淬灭因子随能量增加的模型，不支持DAMA的值；改进了背景模型并进行了新物理搜索。

Conclusion: ANAIS-112实验通过系统校准和模拟，为独立验证DAMA/LIBRA结果提供了重要进展，揭示了淬灭因子的关键作用，并展示了在暗物质搜索中的持续改进和新物理探索。

Abstract: Numerous astronomical and cosmological observations point to the existence of
dark matter, which constitutes about 27% of the Universe. Despite extensive
efforts, only the DAMA/LIBRA experiment, using NaI(Tl) detectors at Gran Sasso
National Laboratory, has reported a positive dark matter signal. To
independently verify this result, using the same NaI target is essential. This
is the goal of ANAIS-112, operating with 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) scintillators
since 2017 at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC). This thesis presents
work within ANAIS-112, focusing on data analysis and the development of
Geant4-based simulations to reduce systematics and increase sensitivity.
Efforts have focused on understanding the ANAIS-112 crystals' response to
nuclear recoils. Systematic uncertainties related to the scintillation
quenching factors (QFs) of sodium and iodine recoiling in NaI(Tl) must be
addressed to ensure reliable comparisons with DAMA/LIBRA and other experiments.
For that purpose, onsite neutron calibrations in ANAIS-112 have been performed
since 2021 at LSC using 252Cf sources. This work has compared calibration data
with Geant4-based neutron simulations, which has revealed Geant4 deficiencies
in certain decay processes and cross sections in some versions. The simulations
have proven highly sensitive to the QF used, favouring models in which the QF
increases with energy and disfavouring DAMA values. In parallel, this thesis
has contributed to improving the ANAIS-112 background model through a
multiparametric fit of its background components. New physics searches have
been conducted using ANAIS-112 data, including a reanalysis of the annual
modulation signal and a search for solar axions using six years of exposure.
Finally, this thesis also includes work within the COSINUS experiment, focused
on background modelling and the impact of internal backgrounds on the
experiment's sensitivity.

### [5] [Singular Value-based Atmospheric Tomography with Fourier Domain Regularization (SAFR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19542)
*Lukas Weissinger,Simon Hubmer,Bernadett Stadler,Ronny Ramlau*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 本文提出了SAFR算法，一种基于SVD的大气层析方法，用于多共轭自适应光学系统，通过FFT和预计算技术实现快速计算和低内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气层析是自适应光学系统的关键组成部分，用于重建大气湍流剖面以提高地面望远镜的成像质量。现有方法计算量大、内存需求高，需要更高效的算法。

Method: 使用基于奇异值分解(SVD)的SAFR算法，结合傅里叶域正则化和FFT技术，预计算计算密集型部分，减少内存需求。

Result: 在COMPASS仿真环境中测试，SAFR算法在重建质量和计算效率方面表现优异，相比传统矩阵向量乘法方法具有更快的速度和更低的内存需求。

Conclusion: SAFR算法为多共轭自适应光学系统提供了一种高效的大气层析解决方案，特别适用于ELT望远镜的MORFEO仪器。

Abstract: Atmospheric tomography, the problem of reconstructing atmospheric turbulence
profiles from wavefront sensor measurements, is an integral part of many
adaptive optics systems. It is used to enhance the image quality of
ground-based telescopes, such as for the Multiconjugate Adaptive Optics Relay
For ELT Observations (MORFEO) instrument on the Extremely Large Telescope
(ELT). To solve this problem, a singular-value decomposition (SVD) based
approach has been proposed before. In this paper, we focus on the numerical
implementation of the SVD-based Atmospheric Tomography with Fourier Domain
Regularization Algorithm (SAFR) and its performance for Multi-Conjugate
Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems. The key features of the SAFR algorithm are the
utilization of the FFT and the pre-computation of computationally demanding
parts. Together, this yields a fast algorithm with less memory requirements
than commonly used Matrix Vector Multiplication (MVM) approaches. We evaluate
the performance of SAFR regarding reconstruction quality and computational
expense in numerical experiments using the simulation environment COMPASS, in
which we use an MCAO setup resembling the physical parameters of the MORFEO
instrument of the ELT.

### [6] [A resistive MHD module in the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18968)
*Sara Azizi,Swapnil Shankar,Philipp Mösta,Roland Haas,Erik Schnetter*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 本文提出了GRaM-X代码的电阻版本，用于模拟相对论性磁流体动力学，通过隐式-显式Runge-Kutta方案处理刚性源项，并在GPU加速下实现高效大规模模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理想GRMHD假设无限电导率，忽略了电阻效应，而这些效应对于磁重联、耗散和磁层动力学等过程至关重要。在真实天体物理环境中，等离子体并非完美导体，因此需要包含电阻效应的模型。

Method: 使用Z4c形式演化爱因斯坦方程，实现二阶隐式-显式Runge-Kutta方案处理刚性源项，采用一维恢复方法从守恒量获取原始量，结合HLLE黎曼解算器与TVD和WENO重构方案。

Result: 通过1D激波管、电流片、阿尔芬波、2D圆柱爆炸和3D TOV星等一系列标准测试验证，准确恢复了理想MHD极限，展示了正确的电阻行为和在动态时空中的稳定演化。

Conclusion: GPU加速的电阻版本GRaM-X能够实现高效大规模模拟，为多信使天体物理框架下的双星合并、吸积流和相对论性喷流等研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Relativistic macroscopic plasma dynamics can be described by
general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. In many high-energy astrophysical
settings, such as the interior dynamics of magnetized stars, the ideal GRMHD
approximation, in which we assume infinite conductivity, provides an excellent
description. However, ideal GRMHD neglects resistive effects that are essential
for processes such as magnetic reconnection, dissipation, and magnetospheric
dynamics. Incorporating resistivity into astrophysical plasma models accounts
for the fact that plasmas in such environments are not perfect conductors. We
present a resistive version of the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X, which
evolves the full resistive GRMHD equations using the Z4c formalism for
Einstein's equations. We implement a second-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta
scheme to handle stiff source terms, obtain the primitive quantities from the
conserved quantities using a one-dimensional recovery method, and employ the
HLLE Riemann solver in combination with TVD and WENO reconstruction schemes. We
validate the module using a range of standard tests, including 1D shocktubes,
current sheets, Alfv\'{e}n waves, 2D cylindrical explosions, and 3D TOV stars.
The results of these tests demonstrate accurate recovery of the ideal MHD
limit, correct resistive behavior, and stable evolution in dynamical
spacetimes. Leveraging the GPU-accelerated resistive version of GRaM-X enables
efficient large-scale simulations, paving the way for realistic studies of
binary mergers, accretion flows, and relativistic jets within the framework of
multi-messenger astrophysics.

TL;DR: 使用VERITAS观测NGC 1275耀斑数据搜索轴子状粒子(ALPs)，未发现ALPs存在的证据，在特定质量范围内设置了置信度达80%的排除限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轴子状粒子是标准模型扩展理论中的假设粒子，其与电磁场的耦合会在外部磁场中与光子混合，可能在TeV伽马射线源光谱中留下印记。

Method: 使用gammapy分析包分析VERITAS的NGC 1275耀斑数据，进行广泛拟合和建模，采用CLs方法进行似然分析以搜索ALPs证据并设置限制。

Result: 未发现ALPs存在的证据，在质量范围2×10^-7eV至4×10^-7eV和耦合强度g_aγ≥3×10^-11 GeV^-1处设置了置信度达80%的最强排除限制。

Conclusion: CLs方法被证明是可靠的方法，建议在灵敏度有限的情况下采用这种保守的限制设置方法。

Abstract: Background: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical particles that
emerge in numerous theoretical extensions to the Standard Model. Their coupling
to electromagnetic field implies that ALPs would mix with photons in the
presence of external magnetic fields. As ALP phenomenology is governed by the
mass and strength of its coupling, there is a subset of this parameter space in
which this mixing would be expected to leave an imprint on the spectra of TeV
gamma-ray sources.
  Data: In 2017, the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory recorded the second day of a
dramatic flare of the radio galaxy NGC 1275, embedded at the center of the
Perseus galaxy cluster. This serendipitous locale provides a spatially-extended
magnetic field of strength O(10$\mu$G) through which escaping photons traverse,
making it an excellent target to study ALPs.
  Methods: We analyze the VERITAS data of NGC 1275's 2017 flare with the
gammapy analysis package. Extensive fitting and modeling are performed to
ultimately conduct a likelihood analysis used to search for any evidence of a
preference for ALPs and to explore the confidence with which constraints can be
set. We adopt the CLs method for this study for its conservative approach to
setting limits in regimes where the search has limited sensitivity.
  Results: No evidence for the existence of ALPs is found, and no combination
of mass and coupling strength can be excluded at or above 95% confidence level.
We provide a map showing the strength of our exclusions in the mass and
coupling parameter space. The strongest exclusions are found in the mass range
$2 \times 10^{-7}$eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-7}$eV and at the
coupling strength of $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ up to
80% confidence level, which are consistent with previous studies.
  Conclusions: We find the CLs method to be a trustworthy approach, and
advocate for its...

### [8] [X-ray Observations of Nova Scorpii 2023 (V1716 Sco) in Outburst](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19102)
*John Worley,Marina Orio,Andrej Dobrotka,Jozef Magdolen,Kim Page,Ehud Behar,Jeremy Drake,Sharon Mitrani*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Nova Scorpii 2023是一颗超软X射线源，观测显示其具有77.9秒周期性调制，可能与白矮星自转相关，表明存在约1.2太阳质量的巨大白矮星。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究新星爆发后的超软X射线源演化过程，特别是白矮星质量和自转特性的探测。

Method: 使用Swift XRT、NICER和Chandra HRC/LETG望远镜进行多波段X射线观测，分析光谱和时间变化特性。

Result: 探测到77.9秒的稳定周期性调制，超软X射线相持续约9个月，温度拟合表明存在1.2太阳质量的白矮星。

Conclusion: 观测到的周期性调制可能与白矮星自转相关，为理解新星系统中白矮星特性提供了重要线索。

Abstract: Nova Scorpii 2023 was first detected as a luminous supersoft X-ray source
(SSS) 93 days after outburst and continued emitting soft X-rays for over two
months, until it was too close to the Sun to observe. The nova was monitored
with the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) and the Neutron Star Interior Composition
Explorer (NICER) on the International Space Station, and in long exposures with
the Chandra High Resolution Camera (HRC) and Low Energy Transmission Grating
(LETG) on days 128, 129, and 183-185 after optical maximum. Swift detected a
rapidly decaying SSS when observations resumed, constraining the constant
bolometric luminosity phase to 9 months. The SSS flux was irregularly variable.
A nearly three-fold increase in flux was observed between August and October
2023 in the 15 to 35 Angstrom range, from 3.5 x 10^(-11) to 9.4 x 10^(-11) erg
cm^(-2) s^(-1). The SSS duration and effective temperature derived from the
October LETG spectra indicate a massive white dwarf with temperature fitting
nova evolutionary tracks for a 1.2 solar mass WD; emission lines superimposed
on the WD continuum are attributed to surrounding shocked ejecta. We present a
timing study based on Chandra and archival NICER data. The irregular
variability timescale was days, but a 77.9 second periodic modulation in the
SSS flux with varying amplitude was measured in many observations. Our analysis
shows that this period was stable; short drifts derived with NICER, but not in
long, uninterrupted Chandra exposures, are artifacts of measuring variable
amplitude modulation. We suggest the modulations are associated with the WD
rotation.

TL;DR: 对短时伽马暴GRB 250221A的多波段观测分析，发现其具有紧凑双星合并特征但处于稠密环境，挑战了基于持续时间的分类方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究短时伽马暴GRB 250221A的物理特性，探索其起源和分类问题，特别是当爆发特征与环境特征出现矛盾时

Method: 使用COLIBRÍ、Harlingten 50cm望远镜、甚大望远镜的光学和光谱观测，结合Swift、Einstein Probe的X射线数据，以及甚大阵的射电观测

Result: 测得红移z=0.768，发现X射线和光学光变曲线在T0+0.6天出现能量注入特征，环境密度高达80 cm^-3，与短暴的典型稀薄环境不符

Conclusion: GRB 250221A是一个不寻常的事件，其爆发特征支持紧凑双星合并起源，但环境特征更类似于塌缩星环境，凸显了基于持续时间的分类方法的局限性

Abstract: We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-duration
GRB 250221A ($T_{90}=1.80\pm0.32$ s), using a data set from the optical
facilities COLIBR\'I, the Harlingten 50 cm Telescope, and the Very Large
Telescope. We complement these observations with data from the \textit{Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory} and the \textit{Einstein Probe}, as well as radio
observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs
with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination
of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy
with a star-formation rate of $\sim3\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and
optical light curves up to $T_0+10$ ks (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger
time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the
slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at
$T_0+0.6$ days, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the
same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet
with a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=11.5^{\circ}$ through a refreshed shock
powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The
burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the
Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling
of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$),
which is more typical of a Collapsar environment. This tension over the
classification of this burst (short-hard vs. long-soft) as inferred from the
prompt and afterglow emissions makes GRB~250221A an unusual event and
underscores the limitations of duration-based classifications and the
importance of multi-wavelength, time-resolved follow-up observations.

### [10] [Fast Radio Bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19143)
*J. I. Katz*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 快速射电暴（FRB）的起源和辐射机制仍不明确，其亮度温度高达约10^36K，表明是相干辐射，但形成相干电荷束的等离子体物理机制尚不清楚。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管快速射电暴发现已有18年，但其天文来源和辐射机制仍然是个谜。需要理解这些高亮度、相干辐射现象背后的物理过程，以及它们在不同环境（如星系、球状星团）中的起源。

Method: 通过观测FRB的重复行为、定位其宿主星系（包括红移测量和距离确定），分析其辐射特性和周围环境条件。

Result: 发现部分FRB与红移约0.几的星系相关，一个FRB起源于M81星系球状星团（距离3.6Mpc）。少数FRB可重复爆发（有些数千次），但大多数未观测到重复。部分FRB来自密集、快速变化的等离子体环境，其他则似乎处于高真空环境。

Conclusion: 快速射电暴的起源仍然不确定，可能的来源包括磁星和黑洞吸积盘。需要进一步研究来理解这些神秘现象的本质和产生机制。

Abstract: Eighteen years after their discovery, the astronomical sources and radiation
mechanisms of fast radio bursts remain mysterious. Their radiation is as bright
as that of pulsars, with brightness temperatures as high as $\sim 10^{36}$ K,
implying coherent emission, but the plasma physics that forms the coherent
charge bunches, with net charges of order a Coulomb, is not understood. Some
FRB have been identified with galaxies at redshifts of a few tenths, but one
originated within a globular cluster in the galaxy M81 at a distance of 3.6
Mpc. A minority of FRB have been observed to repeat, in some cases thousands of
times. The vast majority of FRB have not been observed to repeat, but it is not
known if they are truly ``one-offs'' or repeat at unobservably long intervals.
Some FRB originate within dense, rapidly varying, plasma environments, while
others appear to be surrounded by high vacuum. Hypotheses for their sources
include magnetars and black hole accretion discs.

Abstract: Dipping neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (NS LMXBs) are systems that
exhibit periodic drops in their X-ray light curves. These are believed to be
caused by material at the impact point of the gas stream onto the accretion
disk, the bulge. Dipping systems are observed at high inclination and provide
exceptional opportunities to address important open questions about accretion
disks, such as the physical properties of the bulge, and the connection between
disk atmospheres and disk winds. We aimed to characterize the accretion disk
plasmas present in the 21h-period NS LMXB 4U 1624-490, and perform a detailed
spectral analysis of the material present at the impact region. We used four
XMM EPIC pn observations that were specifically targeting dips, and allow us to
probe dipping activity over different timescales (i.e. consecutive orbits and
$\sim$6 months). We use both time- and flux-resolved spectroscopic analysis to
probe the structural properties of the bulge moving along the line of sight and
its homogeneity, respectively. During dipping, the primary spectrum is
modulated by an ionized (log$\xi\sim$ 3.4) absorber with varying column density
and covering factor, as well as a colder absorber. This suggests that the bulge
is a multiphase and clumpy absorbing medium. From size scale arguments, we
estimate the number of clumps in the bulge to be $>$7$\times10^{3}$. A highly
ionized disk atmosphere becomes evident only when different phases of
absorption are analyzed individually. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
constructing a physical picture of the bulge, and highlights how future
research could reveal how its properties depend on system parameters, and
whether the bulge could influence the dynamics of the accretion disk.

Abstract: We report wideband scatter-broadening estimates of 14 pulsars towards the Gum
nebula region using the Band-3 of the upgraded GMRT. This work increases the
measurements of frequency scaling index of scatter-broadening ($\alpha$) across
the nebula by more than 3 times. A strong correlation between the distance and
the scattering strength is observed for pulsars behind the nebula. It is also
observed that for distant pulsars ($> 2 kpc$), the effect of the Gum nebula in
DM and scattering strength is not substantial. We also report a much flatter
$\alpha$ for the Vela pulsar and argue that its scattering is not caused by the
Gum nebula, but the Vela supernova remnant.

Abstract: In this thesis, we introduce novel methods for analyzing pulsar populations
using a variety of mathematical techniques. These tools-particularly graph
theory-have been thoroughly validated in advanced mathematics, enabling us to
overcome some of the constraints (even dimensional) inherent in conventional
visualization approaches. This exploration benefits from dimensionality
reduction techniques, which not only lessen computational demands but also
highlight potential for describing physical characteristics. The resulting
structures encode information about pulsar similarities that extend beyond
standard spin parameters, revealing relationships that are not readily apparent
in traditional diagrams. With a physically motivated topological perspective,
we leverage the strengths of these methods and present results that span from
prospective source classification and the emergence of new classes to catalog
comparison, among other applications. This new approach enables fresh
interpretations of longstanding problems, laying a new foundation for
visualizing the pulsar population and categorizing sources. Building on this,
we identify several sources as likely members of specific binary subclasses and
investigate the potential transitional nature of others. Furthermore, we extend
the use of graph theory to the boundary of machine learning, demonstrating its
capability for binary separation in an unsupervised context. Finally, we
introduce and apply an innovative, flexible time-series alignment technique to
the field of gamma-ray astrophysics. The method identifies notable similarities
among the light curves of gamma-ray pulsars. The results presented here are
promising, offering a refreshing direction for the field and new pathways for
rigorous mathematical analysis, ultimately providing meaningful alternatives to
traditional approaches in high-energy astrophysics.

Abstract: This paper explores how time-varying increases in mass accretion onto rapidly
spinning black holes influence their long-term spin evolution when affected by
superradiance - a process where energy is extracted from the black hole by a
surrounding axion field. Using simulations the study tracks how sudden
accretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop)
during which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains
nearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition
between two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion,
and how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that
boosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest
effect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the
region of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance. In
particular, a super-Eddington accretion rate of 5 times Eddington accretion,
lasting for 4 Myr and occurring 30 Myr before the superradiance drop can reduce
the superradiance exclusion region in the mass-spin plane by 40 percent. In
contrast, boosts to the accretion rate after the superradiance drop only cause
temporary changes in the black hole spin. The study also shows that black holes
with lighter axion clouds are more sensitive to these early boosts and can show
observable spin changes lasting tens to hundreds of millions of years. Heavier
axion clouds, however, require much stronger or longer-lasting boosts to
produce similar effects, making them more stable under variable accretion.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了超新星冲击波与复杂星周介质（CSM）壳层相互作用时产生的伽马射线和多波段辐射特征，发现与平滑星风模型相比，CSM壳层能显著增强伽马射线发射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型假设超新星冲击波在平滑星风中膨胀，但许多观测不支持这一假设。本文旨在研究冲击波在包含密集CSM壳层的复杂密度剖面中膨胀时的粒子加速和辐射特征。

Method: 使用PION代码模拟LBV周围的CSM和RSG周围的光电离约束壳层形成，然后使用RATPaC代码研究超新星在这些介质中膨胀时的宇宙线加速和全电磁波谱辐射。

Result: 与CSM壳层相互作用能显著增强伽马射线发射，峰值光度可比平滑星风模型高数个量级。Type-IIP超新星的峰值在爆发后数年才达到，而Type-IIn则较早。

Conclusion: 高频率光学巡天和持续射电监测是识别伽马射线观测目标的最佳策略，预测伽马射线在晚期相互作用时可探测到几Mpc，早期相互作用时可探测到数十Mpc。

Abstract: Early interaction of supernova blast waves with CSM has the potential to
accelerate particles to PeV energies, although this has not yet been detected.
Current models for this interaction assume the shock expands into a smooth
stellar wind, although observations of many SNe do not support this assumption.
  We extend previous work by considering shocks expanding into complex density
profiles consisting of smooth winds with dense CSM shells at various distances
from the progenitor star. We aim to predict the gamma-ray and multiwavelength
signatures of CSM interaction.
  We used the PION code to model the CSM around LBV including a brief episode
of enhanced mass-loss and to simulate the formation of photoionization-confined
shells around RSGs. Consequently, we used the time-dependent acceleration-code
RATPaC to study the acceleration of cosmic rays in SNe expanding into these
media and to evaluate the emitted radiation across the whole electromagnetic
spectrum.
  We find that the interaction with the CSM shells can significantly boost the
gamma-ray emission, with the emission peaking weeks to years after the
explosion. The peak luminosity for Type-IIP and Type-IIn remnants can exceed
the luminosity expected for smooth winds by orders of magnitude. For Type-IIP
explosions, the light-curve peak is only reached years after the explosion. We
evaluate the multiwavelength signatures expected from the interaction of the
blast wave with a dense CSM shell from radio, over optical, to thermal X-rays.
  We identify high-cadence optical surveys and continuous monitoring of nearby
SN in radio and mm wavelengths as the best-suited strategies for identifying
targets that should be followed-up by gamma-ray observatories. We predict that
gamma-rays from interaction with dense CSM shells may be detectable out to a
few Mpc for late interaction, and tens of Mpc for early interaction.

Abstract: In the vicinity of neutron star mergers (NSMs), it is possible for the
neutrino self-interaction potential to cancel with the matter potential leading
to matter neutrino resonance (MNR). MNR is one of the most interesting
mechanisms by which neutrino flavor evolution can occur in dense astrophysical
environments. Previous studies have typically assumed that the neutrino flavor
field evolves to a steady state -- a simplification also used in other
self-interaction models such as the neutrino-bulb model. Here, we perform
reproducible calculations of MNR using both time-independent and time-dependent
formalisms and show that they yield qualitatively different flavor survival
probabilities. The time-independent approach produces unstable steady-state
solutions that differ fundamentally from the dynamical behavior captured in
time-dependent simulations. These results demonstrate that the steady-state
assumption is generally invalid, and physical interpretations based on
time-independent calculations of dense neutrino systems require re-evaluation.

Abstract: Powerful ionized accretion disk winds are often observed during episodic
outbursts in Galactic black hole transients. Among those X-ray absorbers,
\fexxvi\ doublet structure (Ly$\alpha_1$+Ly$\alpha_2$ with $\sim 20$eV apart)
has a unique potential to better probe the underlying physical nature of the
wind; i.e. density and kinematics. We demonstrate, based on a
physically-motivated magnetic disk wind scenario of a stratified structure in
density and velocity, that the doublet line profile can be effectively utilized
as a diagnostics to measure wind density and associated velocity dispersion
(due to thermal turbulence and/or dynamical shear motion in winds). Our
simulated doublet spectra with post-process radiative transfer calculations
indicate that the profile can be (1) broad with a single peak for higher
velocity dispersion ($\gsim 5,000$ km~s$^{-1}$), (2) a standard shape with 1:2
canonical flux ratio for moderate dispersion ($\sim 1,000-5,000$ km~s$^{-1}$)
or (3) double-peaked with its flux ratio approaching 1:1 for lower velocity
dispersion ($\lsim 1,000$ km~s$^{-1}$) in optically-thin regime, allowing
various line shape. Such a diversity in doublet profile is indeed unambiguously
seen in recent observations with XRISM/Resolve at microcalorimeter resolution.
We show that some implications inferred from the model will help constrain the
local wind physics where \fexxvi\ is predominantly produced in a large-scale,
stratified wind.

Abstract: The $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As
thermonuclear reactions connect the ZnGa and GeAs cycles by diverting the flow
of the rapid proton capture process from $^{63}$Ga to $^{65}$As. Changes in
these two reaction rates regulate the ZnGa and GeAs cycles and may affect the
modeled properties matching with the observed counterparts of a type I X-ray
burster. We implement the latest $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and
$^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As reaction rates to the state-of-the-art
self-consistent one-dimensional multi-zone thermo-hydrodynamic code, KEPLER, to
study the influence of these new reaction rates on the models of the GS
1826$-$24 clocked burster and SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion
burster. Both new reaction rates obtained by Lu et al. [Phys. Rev. C 110,
065804 (2024)] are determined from complementing the experimental input with
the nuclear spectroscopic information deduced from the full pf-shell space
configuration-interaction shell-model calculations. By constraining the models
on reproducing the observed burst peak, light-curve profile, fluence, and
recurrence time, we find that the impact of the newly measured proton
thresholds and respective proton-capture reactions on the burst light-curve
profile of the GS 1826$-$24 clocked burster is, in fact, not as significant as
claimed by Zhou et al. [Nat. Phys. 19, 1091 (2023)]. With or without the
inclusion of the newly determined reaction rate of the highly influential
$^{22}$Mg($\alpha$,p)$^{25}$Al reaction, the impact of the new
$^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As reaction
rates on SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion bursts is evident.
Our finding indicates that the models reproducing the 2002 October epoch of SAX
J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion burster is more sensitive to the
uncertainties of thermonuclear reaction rates.

Abstract: Accretion in black hole X-ray binaries is commonly believed to be supplied by
the Roche lobe overflow or the stellar wind. The former is thought to form a
geometrically thin disc while the diffuse wind could form a geometrically thick
hot accretion flow. In this paper, we instead consider a more generalised case,
i.e., accretion with both cold and hot gas supplies, which feed a disc and a
corona respectively. We investigate the interaction of disc and corona by
analysing the energy coupling and matter exchange, i.e. corona
condensation/disc evaporation, with a semi-analytical method. It is found that
the accretion geometry in the radial direction and the resultant emission
spectrum depend strongly on both the total gas supply rate and the ratio of
cold and hot gases. For gas supply rates of a few percent of the Eddington
value, diverse geometries and spectral shapes are possible, depending on the
fraction of cold gas supply. This provides an interpretation for the various
spectra observed in intermediate states. However, at higher accretion rates,
regardless of the form of the feeding gas, the inner accretion flow is always
disc-dominated, implying an inevitable transition to the soft state, while at
very low gas supply rates, hard state spectrum dominated by the hot flow is
expected. We also present the predicted hardness-intensity correlation of
Cygnus X-1, and constrain the value of the viscosity parameter of the accretion
flow to the range of 0.25--0.35 by comparing our results with MAXI
observations.

TL;DR: 论文发现地面无线电信号的电场幅度与大气中X_max位置有强相关性，这种相关性可用于推断宇宙射线原初成分，即使不重建X_max也能实现事件级成分分析。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上认为无线电信号的LDF形状包含成分信息，但忽略了幅度也可能包含重要的成分信息。研究旨在揭示X_max对LDF幅度的影响及其在成分分析中的应用价值。

Method: 通过分析无线电信号的电场幅度与X_max位置的关系，识别出两种竞争性的缩放机制：空气密度缩放(1/ρ)^J和距离缩放(1/R)，并考虑不同天顶角下的相干性损失效应。

Result: 发现低天顶角时(1/R)缩放占主导，X_max增加导致电场幅度增大；高天顶角时相干性损失效应复杂化这一关系。这种幅度对X_max的依赖可用于直接推断宇宙射线成分。

Conclusion: LDF幅度对X_max/成分的强烈依赖是历史上被忽视的重要效应，可绕过X_max重建直接进行成分分析，并对其他无线电重建方法产生影响。

Abstract: We show that there is a strong dependence of the radio LDF electric field
amplitudes at ground level on the position of $X_{\rm max}$ in the atmosphere,
even accounting for differences in the EM energy of the showers. Since an
$X_{\rm max}$ dependence leads to a primary composition dependence, this
implies that information on the mass composition is encoded not only in the LDF
shape but also in its amplitude. This $X_{\rm max}$ dependence can be explained
in terms of two competing scalings of the measured electric field: One goes
with $(1/\rho)^J$, where $\rho$ is the air density at $X_{\rm max}$ and $J$ is
a zenith dependent non-linearity factor describing coherence loss. This density
scaling tends to decrease the geomagnetic emission of deeper showers. The other
scaling goes with $(1/R)$, where $R$ is the distance from $X_{\rm max}$ to the
core at ground, and instead increases the measured electric field of deeper
showers. At low zenith angles, the $(1/R)$ scaling is stronger and leads to
larger measured electric fields as $X_{\rm max}$ increases. The picture at
higher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the
deflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time
delays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission.
This loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic
field and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission
with decreasing air density. This strong, yet historically overlooked LDF
amplitude dependence on $X_{\rm max}$/composition could be used to directly
infer, even bypassing any $X_{\rm max}$ reconstruction, the cosmic ray primary
composition on an event-by-event basis. It could also have some repercussions
on other radio reconstruction methods, such as a possible $X_{\rm
max}$/composition bias on shower electromagnetic energy reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Time series analysis is fundamental to characterizing the variability
inherent in multi-wavelength emissions from blazars. However, a major
observational challenge lies in the need for well-sampled, temporally uniform
data, which is often hindered by irregular sampling and data gaps. These gaps
can significantly affect the reliability and accuracy of methods used to probe
source variability. This paper investigates the impact of such observational
gaps on time series analysis of blazar emissions. To do so, we systematically
evaluate how these gaps alter observed variability patterns, mask genuine
periodic signals, and introduce false periodicity detections. This evaluation
is conducted using both simulated and real observational data. We assess a
range of widely used time series analysis methods, including the Lomb-Scargle
periodogram, Phase Dispersion Minimization, and the recently proposed Singular
Spectrum Analysis (SSA). Our results demonstrate a clear and significant
degradation in period detection reliability when the percentage of gaps exceeds
50\%. In such cases, the period-significance relationship becomes increasingly
distorted, often leading to misleading results. Among the tested methods, SSA
stands out for its ability to yield consistent and robust detections despite
high data incompleteness. Additionally, the analyzed methods tend to identify
artificial periodicities of around one year, likely due to seasonal sampling
effects, which can result in false positives if not carefully recognized.
Finally, the periods detected with $\geq$3$\sigma$ confidence are unlikely to
result from stochastic processes or from the presence of gaps in the analyzed
time series.

Motivation: 解释IceCube探测到的TeV-PeV中微子起源，特别是NGC 7469作为潜在中微子发射源的物理机制，以及其与NGC 1068中微子谱差异的原因。

Method: 分析Fermi-LAT对NGC 7469的观测数据，结合IceCube中微子探测结果，通过要求伴随中微子产生的级联通量不超过GeV通量上限来约束中微子发射区域大小。

Result: NGC 7469的中微子谱比NGC 1068更硬，由两个高能中微子事件主导，质子最大能量>2 PeV。在湍流加速和磁重联两种场景下都能实现所需质子能量，但需要不同的磁化参数。

Conclusion: NGC 7469中的质子可能通过湍流或磁重联在日冕中被加速到PeV能量，通过与吸积盘光子相互作用产生100-200 TeV中微子。NGC 7469与NGC 1068中微子谱的差异可能源于磁化参数的不同。

Abstract: The origin of TeV-PeV neutrinos detected by IceCube remains largely unknown.
The most significant individual neutrino source is the close-by Seyfert galaxy
NGC 1068 at 4.2$\sigma$ level with a soft spectral index. Another notable
candidate is the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, which has been recently proposed as a
potential neutrino emitter. The likelihood fit of the IceCube data for this
source returned a very hard spectral index of ~ 1.9 and the excess is dominated
by two high-energy events, issued as two neutrino alerts IC220424A and
IC230416A. The energies of the two neutrinos are estimated to be 100-200 TeV,
implying a maximum proton energy > 2 PeV, significantly higher than that in NGC
1068. The lack of lower-energy neutrinos from NGC 7469 also suggests a neutrino
spectrum harder than that of NGC 1068. In this paper, we analyze the Fermi-LAT
observations of NGC 7469, which yield non-detection. By requiring the cascade
flux accompanying neutrino production not to exceed the upper limit of the GeV
flux, the size of the neutrino-emitting region can be constrained when the
neutrino flux takes a high value of the allowed range. We suggest that protons
are accelerated to PeV energies via turbulence or magnetic reconnection in the
corona of NGC 7469 and interact with OUV photons from the accretion disk and
X-rays from the corona through the $p\gamma$ process, producing neutrinos with
energy of 100-200 TeV. In the turbulence acceleration scenario, the required
maximum proton energy can be achieved with a magnetization parameter close to
unity ($\sigma\sim 1$), while in the reconnection scenario, a magnetization
parameter with $\sigma\sim 10$ is needed. In both scenarios, a pair dominated
composition for the corona is preferred. The difference in the neutrino
spectrum between NGC 7469 and NGC 1068 could be due to a different
magnetization despite that they belong to the same type of AGN.

Abstract: We present an analysis of neutrino-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and
instabilities in a rotating magnetoplasma with weak neutrino interactions. We
show, for the first time, that neutrino-driven shear Alfv{\'e}n and oblique
magnetosonic waves can be coupled by the Coriolis force, forming new wave modes
affected by this force, as well as neutrino beam and two neutrino flavor
oscillations. Our work extends previous theories by demonstrating that shear
Alfv{\'e}n waves are influenced by neutrino effects and by identifying
instabilities resulting from resonant interactions with both a streaming
neutrino beam and flavor oscillations. We find that the Coriolis force, as well
as plasma density and magnetic field strength, have a significant impact on the
profiles of the instability growth rates. Our findings may shed new light on
the physical mechanisms underlying core-collapse supernovae.
