TL;DR: 盖亚任务通过10年观测创建了最大的全天球分类变源星表，使用机器学习技术处理超过20亿颗恒星的时间序列数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理盖亚任务收集的海量时间序列数据（超过20亿颗恒星），从中提取有意义的变源信息，需要高效的自动化分析方法。

Method: 采用机器学习技术进行交叉匹配、变源检测和变源分类，处理盖亚任务的多次天体测量、测光、分光测光和光谱测量数据。

Result: 创建了迄今为止最大的全天球分类变源星表，探测深度达到G ~ 21星等，覆盖从秒到年时间尺度的变源。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法成功应用于盖亚任务的海量数据处理，为变源研究提供了前所未有的全面数据集。

Abstract: The Gaia mission has observed over 2 billion stars repeatedly across the
entire sky over 10 years, revealing the many astronomical objects that vary on
human timescales from seconds to years. Its repeated astrometric, photometric,
spectrophotometric and spectroscopic measurements create an unprecedented
dataset to probe the variable celestial sources down to G ~ 21 mag. To extract
meaningful results from these many time series for so many sources, we have
used machine learning techniques for crossmatching, variability detection, and
variability classification. This approach has now led to the largest catalogue
of classified variable sources ever produced over the entire celestial sphere.

TL;DR: 应用SGP算法对ZTF观测图像进行单波段去卷积，在恒星源上表现出良好的光度保持和FWHM改善，能发现新暗弱源并实现潜在的去混叠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面天文观测受大气视宁度影响，去卷积可以逆转这种效应，提升科学数据质量。

Method: 使用Scaled Gradient Projection (SGP)算法对ZTF观测图像进行单波段去卷积处理。

Result: 去卷积后源具有约1像素的FWHM，检测完整性≥99.6%，能发现新暗弱源，比Richardson-Lucy算法更好且快8倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在光度保持、源检测和去混叠方面表现优异，适合集成到巡天数据处理流程中。

Abstract: Ground-based astronomical observations will continue to produce
resolution-limited images due to atmospheric seeing. Deconvolution reverses
such effects and thus can benefit extracted science in multifaceted ways. We
apply the Scaled Gradient Projection (SGP) algorithm for the single-band
deconvolution of several observed images from the Zwicky Transient Facility and
mainly discuss the performance on stellar sources. The method shows good
photometric flux preservation, which deteriorates for fainter sources but
significantly reduces flux uncertainties even for the faintest sources.
Deconvolved sources have a well-defined Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum (FWHM) of
roughly one pixel (one arcsecond for ZTF) regardless of the observed seeing.
Detection after deconvolution results in catalogs with $\gtrsim$99.6%
completeness relative to detections in the observed images. A few observed
sources that could not be detected in the deconvolved image are found near
saturated sources, whereas for others, the deconvolved counterparts are
detected when slightly different detection parameters are used. The
deconvolution reveals new faint sources previously undetectable, which are
confirmed by crossmatching with the deeper DESI Legacy DR10 and with
Pan-STARRS1 through forced photometry. The method could identify examples of
serendipitous potential deblends that exceeded SExtractor's deblending
capabilities, with as extreme as $\Delta m \approx 3$ and separations as small
as one arcsecond between the deblended components. Our survey-agnostic approach
is better and eight times faster than Richardson-Lucy deconvolution and could
be a reliable method for incorporation into survey pipelines.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: BOOM是一个实时联合处理天文警报流的分析框架，专为处理ZTF和未来LSST的大规模警报数据而设计，性能比现有ZTF系统高8倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着高吞吐量巡天望远镜的出现和多信使、多波长仪器的补充，急需能够处理相关数据流的软件。现有系统无法满足ZTF和未来LSST（每晚约2千万警报）的数据处理需求。

Method: 基于Rust软件栈构建，使用非关系型MongoDB数据库、Valkey内存处理队列和Kafka消息共享集群，实现实时处理工作流。

Result: 系统性能比现有ZTF系统高约8倍，实现了与现有系统的功能对等，并展示了自定义过滤器的处理能力。

Conclusion: BOOM为Rubin时代做好了准备，将作为公共LSST警报代理Babamul的基础框架继续发展。

Abstract: With the arrival of ever higher throughput wide-field surveys and a multitude
of multi-messenger and multi-wavelength instruments to complement them,
software capable of harnessing these associated data streams is urgently
required. To meet these needs, a number of community supported alert brokers
have been built, currently focused on processing of Zwicky Transient Facility
(ZTF; $\sim 10^5$-$10^6$ alerts per night) with an eye towards Vera C. Rubin
Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST; $\sim 2 \times 10^7$
alerts per night). Building upon the system that successfully ran in production
for ZTF's first seven years of operation, we introduce BOOM (Burst & Outburst
Observations Monitor), an analysis framework focused on real-time, joint
brokering of these alert streams. BOOM harnesses the performance of a
Rust-based software stack relying on a non-relational MongoDB database combined
with a Valkey in-memory processing queue and a Kafka cluster for message
sharing. With this system, we demonstrate feature parity with the existing ZTF
system with a throughput $\sim 8 \times$ higher. We describe the workflow that
enables the real-time processing as well as the results with custom filters we
have built to demonstrate the system's capabilities. In conclusion, we present
the development roadmap for both BOOM and Babamul - the public-facing LSST
alert broker built atop BOOM - as we begin the Rubin era.

### [4] [StarDICE IV: Characterizing atmosphere gray extinction with thermal infrared observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00182)

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: StarDICE实验提出使用红外热像仪辐射测量来校正光度数据中的灰霾消光效应，目标是在griz波段达到1 mmag精度。该方法通过热辐射过剩和校准星通量差异来拟合消光校正模型，显著提高了图像精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大气效应特别是云层引起的灰霾消光对光度测量精度的影响，这是实现1 mmag精度目标的主要挑战。

Method: 使用红外热像仪同步辐射测量，基于热辐射过剩和校准星通量差异逐图像拟合灰霾消光校正模型，结合现场环境监测、辐射传输模拟和Gaia DR3星表数据。

Result: 校正后残差显著降低，消光校正图分辨率达2角分，精度约0.01星等。最严重灰霾曝光的平均绝对误差从0.64降至0.11星等，非理想序列的消光时间变化可降至0.025星等。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效校正灰霾消光，显著提高光度测量精度，为StarDICE实验的应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The StarDICE experiment seeks to establish a metrology chain linking
laboratory standards to astrophysical fluxes, targeting 1 mmag accuracy in the
$\textit{griz}$ bands. Reaching this precision requires mitigating variable
atmospheric effects, especially gray extinction from clouds, which remains a
major challenge. To address this challenge, we present a novel method for
correcting photometric data using simultaneous radiometric measurements from an
infrared thermal camera. The gray extinction correction model is fitted on an
image-by-image basis as a function of thermal radiance excess and difference
between synthetic and instrumental fluxes of calibration stars. This approach
stands out by avoiding any assumptions about spatial structure and leveraging a
forward model combining in situ environmental monitoring, radiative transfer
simulations and use of Gaia Data Release 3 star catalogs. We demonstrate the
method using data collected from a dedicated experimental remote observation
system, built to conduct repeated observations of two fields over several
nights in varying atmosphere conditions. We show that applying the correction
model to each source in the test sample results in a reduction of residuals
between corrected and reference magnitudes. It delivers extinction correction
maps for individual images with a resolution of 2 arcmin and an accuracy of
$\sim$0.01 mag. This leads to a significant improvement in accuracy per image,
with the mean absolute error decreasing from 0.64 to 0.11 mag for the most gray
extinguished exposures. The temporal variations in extinction for non-ideal
photometric sequences can be reduced to 0.025 mag per source, which is
promising for its application in StarDICE.

### [5] [ATCAT: Astronomical Timeseries CAusal Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00614)
*Zora Tung*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的轻量级模型，在ELAsTiCC挑战中实现了新的最优分类性能，在仅使用光变曲线数据时达到71.8% F1分数，结合元数据时达到89.8% F1分数，同时训练速度提升9倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为应对LSST望远镜将产生的海量时域天文数据分类需求，需要开发可扩展、准确且高效的分类方法。

Method: 使用小型Transformer模型和改进的光变曲线编码逻辑，结合正则化、自举集成和无监督预训练实现标签高效训练，即使仅使用10%标注数据也能保持良好性能。

Result: 模型在LC-only分类中达到71.8% F1（之前最优为65.5%），在LC+metadata分类中达到89.8% F1（之前最优为84%），在所有时间截断点上都优于先前最优模型，推理速度达33000光变曲线/秒。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模天文时域数据分类提供了高效解决方案，能够有效应对数据漂移问题，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory
will capture light curves (LCs) for 10 billion sources and produce millions of
transient candidates per night, necessitating scalable, accurate, and efficient
classification. To prepare the community for this scale of data, the Extended
LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC) sought to
simulate a diversity of LSST-like time-domain events. Using a small
transformer-based model and refined light curve encoding logic, we present a
new state of the art classification performance on ELAsTiCC, with 71.8% F1 on
LC-only classifications, and 89.8% F1 on LC+metadata classifications. Previous
state of the art was 65.5% F1 for LC-only, and for LC+metadata, 84% F1 with a
different setup and 83.5% F1 with a directly comparable setup. Our model
outperforms previous state-of-the-art models for fine-grained early detection
at all time cutoffs, which should help prioritize candidate transients for
follow-up observations. We demonstrate label-efficient training by removing
labels from 90% of the training data (chosen uniformly at random), and
compensate by leveraging regularization, bootstrap ensembling, and unsupervised
pretraining. Even with only 10% of the labeled data, we achieve 67.4% F1 on
LC-only and 87.1% F1 on LC+metadata, validating an approach that should help
mitigate synthetic and observational data drift, and improve classification on
tasks with less labeled data. We find that our base model is poorly calibrated
via reliability diagrams, and correct it at a minimal cost to overall
performance, enabling selections by classification precision. Finally, our
GPU-optimized implementation is 9x faster than other state-of-the-art ELAsTiCC
models, and can run inference at ~33000 LCs/s on a consumer-grade GPU, making
it suitable for large-scale applications, and less expensive to train.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 在OpenGadget3中实现了改进的单流体模型，用于模拟气体-尘埃混合物的动力学，包括时间相关的人工粘性和传导性，以及使用压力项处理尘埃扩散的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尘埃动力学在天体物理过程中至关重要，需要开发更有效的数值模拟方法来准确模拟气体-尘埃混合物的行为。

Method: 在OpenGadget3中实现单流体模型，引入时间相关的人工粘性和传导性，以及使用压力项处理尘埃扩散的新方法。通过一系列基准测试验证模型性能。

Result: 改进后的模型成功通过了所有标准基准测试，在简单和复杂模拟中均表现出稳定性和准确性。新的扩散项改善了高尘埃-气体比和低阻力系数流场的处理能力。

Conclusion: 增强的单流体模型是OpenGadget3中模拟尘埃动力学的可靠工具，虽然保留了原始公式的一些限制，但引入的改进扩展了其适用性并解决了气体-尘埃动力学中的一些挑战。

Abstract: Dust dynamics plays a critical role in astrophysical processes and has been
modeled in hydrodynamical simulations using various approaches. Among
particle-based methods like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), the
One-Fluid model has proven to be highly effective for simulating gas-dust
mixtures. This study presents the implementation of the One-Fluid model in
OpenGadget3, introducing improvements to the original formulation. These
enhancements include time-dependent artificial viscosity and conductivity, as
well as a novel treatment of dust diffusion using a pressure-like term. The
improved model is tested using a suite of dust dynamics benchmark problems:
DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK, with the latter extended to
multidimensional scenarios, as well as a dusty Sedov-Taylor blast wave.
Additional tests include simulations of Cold Keplerian Disks, dusty
protoplanetary disks, and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities to evaluate the
model's robustness in more complex flows. The implementation successfully
passes all standard benchmark tests. It demonstrates stability and accuracy in
both simple and complex simulations. The new diffusion term improves the
handling of flows with large dust-to-gas ratios and low drag coefficients,
although limitations of the One-Fluid model in these regimes remain. The
enhanced One-Fluid model is a reliable and robust tool for simulating dust
dynamics in OpenGadget3. While it retains some limitations inherent to the
original formulation, the introduced improvements expand its applicability and
address some challenges in gas-dust dynamics.

### [7] [Derivative-Aligned Anticipation of Forbush Decreases from Entropy and Fractal Markers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01506)
*Juan D. Perez-Navarro,D. Sierra-Porta*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 提出基于特征的框架，通过追踪信息论、标度和几何学的滑动窗口不变量，从一分钟中子监测数据中预测Forbush下降事件。使用多种标记序列和统计方法，在三个近期FD事件中验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发实用的早期预警工具，补充振幅阈值方法，支持空间天气业务中的临近预报工作流程，通过不变量面板实现对Forbush下降事件的提前预测。

Method: 计算多种标记序列（香农熵、谱熵、排列熵、样本熵、近似熵、Lempel-Ziv复杂度、Hurst指数、相关维数、多种分形维数），应用指数加权移动平均平滑，分析站内标准化导数相对于平滑计数导数最小时间的变化。

Result: 在三个近期FD事件中，紧凑稳健的面板（Hurst指数、Katz分形维数、香农熵、样本熵和Lempel-Ziv复杂度）一致地在计数导数之前出现，提供从数十到数百分钟的可操作提前时间，具体取决于形态学特征。

Conclusion: 该方法支持导数对齐的不变量面板作为实用的早期预警工具，可重现、稳定且无需跨站均质化，能够有效补充振幅阈值并实现空间天气业务中的临近预报。

Abstract: We present a feature-based framework to anticipate Forbush decreases (FDs)
from one-minute neutron-monitor data by tracking sliding-window invariants from
information theory, scaling, and geometry. For each station and event, we
compute marker series (Shannon, spectral, permutation, sample and approximate
entropy; Lempel-Ziv complexity; Hurst via DFA; correlation dimension; Higuchi,
Katz, and Petrosian fractal dimensions), smooth them with an exponentially
weighted moving average, and analyze within-station standardized derivatives
relative to the time of the minimum of the smoothed count derivative. Leads are
reported in minutes (negative = precedes) and station-level significance is
defined on a pre-onset window via a robust z-score detector with bilateral
threshold and persistence; no cross-correlation or hypothesis testing is
required. Applied to three recent FDs (2023-04-23, 2024-03-24, 2024-05-10), a
compact, robust panel-Hurst (DFA), Katz fractal dimension, Shannon and sample
entropy, and Lempel-Ziv-consistently precedes the count derivative with
substantial station coverage, yielding actionable lead times from tens to
several hundred minutes depending on morphology. Some descriptors are
event-dependent: permutation and spectral entropy are strongly anticipatory in
the extreme May 2024 episode but closer to contemporaneous in the rapid March
2024 case. Heatmaps, violin plots, and station overlays corroborate these
patterns. The approach is reproducible from open code, operates on native
station units without cross-station homogenization, and is qualitatively stable
to window, smoothing, and detector settings. These results support
derivative-aligned invariant panels as practical early-warning tools that
complement amplitude thresholds and enable nowcasting workflows in
space-weather operations.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 针对中国空间站巡天望远镜(CSST)的宇宙线污染问题，本文提出了一种基于深度学习的单图像处理方法，包括改进的DeepCR检测模型和创新的形态敏感修复方法，在检测和修复方面都取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSST作为空间望远镜面临严重的宇宙线污染问题，传统多帧叠加方法因巡天策略限制而失效，需要开发有效的单图像处理方法。

Method: 重新训练DeepCR模型用于宇宙线检测，并提出形态敏感修复方法：对恒星/星系区域使用专门训练的UNet++模型，对背景区域使用自适应中值滤波。

Result: 宇宙线检测达到97.90±0.18%召回率和98.67±0.05%精确度；修复方法能有效处理不同强度和位置的宇宙线，将光度误差限制在与未污染源相当的水平，相比掩模方法检测率提高13.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法为下一代空间望远镜提供了稳健的宇宙线缓解方案，解决了单图像处理的关键挑战。

Abstract: As a space telescope, the China Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) will
face significant challenges from cosmic ray (CR) contamination. These CRs will
severely degrade image quality and further influence scientific analysis. Due
to the CSST's sky survey strategy, traditional multi-frame stacking methods
become invalid. The limited revisits prompted us to develop an effective
single-image CR processing method for CSST. We retrained the DeepCR model based
on CSST simulated images and achieved 97.90+-0.18% recall and 98.67+-0.05%
precision on CR detection. Moreover, this paper puts forward an innovative
morphology-sensitive inpainting method, which focuses more on areas with higher
scientific value. We trained a UNet++ model especially on contaminated
stellar/galactic areas, alongside adaptive median filtering for background
regions. This method achieves effective for CRs with different intensities and
different distances from centers of scientific targets. By this approach, the
photometric errors of CR-corrected targets could be restricted to the level
comparable to those of uncontaminated sources. Also, it increases the detection
rate by 13.6% compared to CR masking. This method will provide a robust CR
mitigation for next-generation space telescopes.

TL;DR: 利用凯克天文台作为测试平台，开发验证HWO的波前传感和控制策略，以及完整的系统级段控制架构，为直接成像类地行星做准备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接成像类地行星需要达到10^-10的对比度水平，关键技术障碍是在分段主镜存在下保持皮米级波前稳定性。凯克天文台具备验证HWO段定相策略所需的所有硬件组件。

Method: 使用凯克II望远镜上的Zernike波前传感器，在科学观测并行的情况下闭环感知和校正主镜段活塞，改进NIRC2科学相机的斯特列尔比。

Result: 实现了主镜段活塞的闭环校正，提高了科学相机的斯特列尔比，为HWO波前控制策略验证奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 凯克天文台为HWO提供了理想的测试平台，能够验证控制权限、执行器卸载和环路稳定性等关键问题，并验证HWO误差预算方法学。

Abstract: Exoplanet direct imaging allows us to directly probe and characterize an
exoplanet's atmosphere, searching for signs of life in its atmospheric
signatures. Directly imaging an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star
requires reaching 10$^{-10}$ contrast levels and will be the goal of the
Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). A key technical barrier to reaching such
deep contrasts is maintaining wavefront stability on the order of tens of
picometers, in particular in the presence of a segmented primary mirror. Keck
Observatory is the only facility with all of the hardware components necessary
for validating HWO segment phasing strategies: a large segmented primary
mirror, capacitive edge sensors, deformable mirror, Zernike wavefront sensor
(ZWFS), and high contrast science instruments. Taking advantage of these
parallels, we are using Keck as a testbed for developing and validating HWO
wavefront sensing and control loop strategies, as well as demonstrating the
full system-level segment control architecture for HWO, using existing
infrastructure. Recently, we set the stage for this work by using the ZWFS
installed on the Keck II telescope to sense and correct the primary mirror
segment pistons in closed-loop in parallel with science observations. This
resulted in improved Strehl ratios on the NIRC2 science camera (Salama et al.
2024a). We now aim to directly address concerns related to control authority,
actuator offload, and loop stability - tasks which require Keck's existing
infrastructure, but which do not require picometer wavefront stability.
Moreover, successful comparisons of observed and predicted performances will
validate, on a real operating observatory, the HWO error budget methodology and
in particular its approach to nested loops operating at multiple timescales.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 提出白矮星与玻色子标量场（暗物质）组成的混合系统，通过暗物质贡献5-15%的质量来解释电磁方法与引力红移测量之间的质量差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 白矮星的质量估计中，电磁方法得到的质量与引力红移测量结果存在5-15%的差异，传统解释如热效应、模型不确定性或测量误差无法完全解释这些观测结果。

Method: 构建静态混合配置，将白矮星与玻色子标量场（暗物质）结合形成复合白矮星-玻色子星系统，探索不同解族，分析标量场对质量贡献的比例。

Result: 标量场贡献f_DM ~ 5-15%的质量可以解释观测到的红移过量，该模型为质量偏差提供了物理解释，并允许对标量场配置的质量和紧致度进行初步约束。

Conclusion: 白矮星-玻色子星混合系统能够解释观测到的质量差异，结合贝叶斯模型选择为构成玻色子粒子的质量提供了合理的界限。

Abstract: Mass estimates of white dwarfs via electromagnetic methods, often differ from
those obtained through gravitational redshift measurements, in some cases with
discrepancies ranging in $5-15\%$ across independent datasets. Although many of
the discrepancies reported in large spectroscopic surveys and confirmed by
high-precision techniques such as astrometric microlensing and wide-binary
analyses may be attributable to thermal effects, model uncertainties or
measurement errors prevent a complete description of some of the observations.
Here, we explore an alternative explanation based on the presence of a
gravitationally coupled bosonic scalar field that contributes to the stellar
mass while remaining electromagnetically invisible. We construct stationary,
static mixed configurations consisting of a white dwarf that presents a bosonic
scalar field (dark matter) component, forming a composite white dwarf-boson
star system. We explore families of solutions showing that a scalar field
fraction $f_{\rm DM} \sim 5-15\%$ to the mass contribution can account for the
observed redshift excess. Our models provide a physically motivated explanation
for the mass bias, might offer new observational signatures, and allow us to
place preliminary constraints on the mass and compactness of the scalar field
configuration. Finally, using our theoretical framework in combination with
Bayesian model selection we provide plausible bounds for the mass of the
constituent (ultralight) bosonic particle.

Abstract: At the end of their lives the most massive stars collapse into black holes
(BHs). The detection of an 85 $M_{\odot}$ BH from GW 190521 appeared to
challenge the upper-mass limit imposed by pair-instability (PI). Using
systematic MESA calculations with new mass-loss implementations, we show that
100 $M_{\odot}$ stars at metallicities below 0.1 $Z_{\odot}$ can evolve into
blue supergiant progenitors with cores small enough to avoid PI, yet with
limited envelope loss, yielding remnants within the second mass gap. The key
ingredients involve (i) a proper consideration of internal mixing and (ii)
physically motivated stellar winds. Our modelling provides a robust pathway
that roughly doubles the maximum BH mass permitted by PI theory and establish a
physically-consistent framework to explore the upper BH mass limit versus
metallicity. For rapid rotation ($\ge$50\% of critical), the upper BH mass
comes down to $\simeq$35 $M_{\odot}$, matching the LIGO/Virgo BH mass pile-up.

Abstract: We present results from very deep (485 ks) Chandra X-ray observations of the
relaxed, cool core cluster Abell 2029 (z = 0.0767). A2029 hosts one of the
longest, most continuous sloshing spirals ever observed, which we find extends
nearly 600 kpc from the cluster core. In addition to providing detailed views
of the sloshing spiral, imaging and spectroscopic analysis reveals ICM
substructure related to the merger history including a broad ``splash'' of
cooler gas and a potential merger shock. The radio lobes of the central WAT
source show evidence of alignment with the sloshing motions, consistent with
ICM bulk flow, rather than host-galaxy motion, being the primary driver of lobe
bending. Comparison to a 1:10 mass-ratio off-axis merger simulation indicates
that the observed ICM structures are relics of a second core passage of a
subcluster ~4 Gyr after the start of the merger, where the ``splash'' feature
is revealed to be a wake of cool gas trailing behind the subcluster. Overall,
our results suggest that A2029 is still settling from past interactions --
showing that even the initially most relaxed-looking clusters can be hiding a
rich history of dynamical activity.

Motivation: IceCube合作组最近的中微子观测表明塞弗特星系可能是中微子源，需要建立理论模型来解释这一现象。

Method: 采用标准盘-冕模型，假设质子通过冕区磁化湍流的非共振加速机制被加速，与周围辐射或物质相互作用产生高能中微子和伽马射线。

Conclusion: 未来的MeV伽马射线望远镜（如AMEGO-X和e-ASTROGAM）有望探测到这种伽马射线特征，为强子冕模型提供关键的多信使检验。

Abstract: Recent neutrino observations from the IceCube Collaboration suggest that
Seyfert galaxies are promising candidate sources of neutrinos. Within the
standard disk-corona model, we assume that protons are accelerated by a
non-resonant acceleration mechanism driven by magnetized turbulence in the
corona. These accelerated protons interact with ambient radiation or matter,
producing high-energy neutrinos and gamma rays. In this scenario, gamma rays
are largely absorbed within the corona. The neutrino luminosity depends
primarily on the properties of the corona (such as the X-ray luminosity and
radius) and the spectral energy distribution of the target photons. This study
demonstrates the relation between the neutrino luminosity and the X-ray
luminosity, and further discusses the contribution of cascade gamma rays to
coronal radiation. Notably, MeV gamma rays can effectively escape the source,
together with neutrinos, and serve as key observational probes for testing this
model. Future MeV gamma-ray telescopes, such as AMEGO-X and e-ASTROGAM, are
expected to detect such gamma-ray signatures, providing a critical
multi-messenger test of the hadronic corona model.

consequence of asymmetric Weibel instability. We provide an intuitive physical
picture and a minimal fluid model that captures the essential features of this

provide the missing link between kinetic Weibel turbulence and macroscopic
magnetic fields in astrophysical shocks.

TL;DR: 使用IceCube-DeepCore探测器9年数据搜索暗物质湮灭或衰变产生的中微子信号，未发现显著偏离背景的迹象，给出了暗物质湮灭截面和衰变寿命的严格上限。


<details>

Motivation: 暗物质粒子模型预测其在银河系中心等高密度区域湮灭或衰变可能产生可探测的中微子信号，这为间接探测暗物质提供了重要途径。

Method: 使用IceCube-DeepCore探测器约9年数据，优化了15 GeV至200 GeV能量区间的事件选择，考虑了多种湮灭和衰变通道，暗物质质量范围从15 GeV到8 TeV。

Result: 未发现显著偏离大气中微子和μ子背景的信号，最显著结果对应201.6 GeV暗物质质量湮灭到b夸克对，后验显著性仅为1.08σ。给出了热平均湮灭截面上限约10⁻²⁴ cm³/s，衰变寿命下限达10²⁶秒。

Conclusion: 这些结果加强了IceCube对20 GeV以上暗物质质量的现有限制，在较低质量区间提升了一个数量级，代表了中微子望远镜对GeV尺度暗物质的最强约束，在多个暗物质情景中处于世界领先水平。

Abstract: Models describing dark matter as a novel particle often predict that its
annihilation or decay into Standard Model particles could produce a detectable
neutrino flux in regions of high dark matter density, such as the Galactic
Center. In this work, we search for these neutrinos using $\sim$9 years of
IceCube-DeepCore data with an event selection optimized for energies between 15
GeV to 200 GeV. We considered several annihilation and decay channels and dark
matter masses ranging from 15 GeV up to 8 TeV. No significant deviation from
the background expectation from atmospheric neutrinos and muons was found. The
most significant result was found for a dark matter mass of 201.6 GeV
annihilating into a pair of $b\bar{b}$ quarks assuming the Navarro-Frenk-White
halo profile with a post-trial significance of $1.08 \;\sigma$. We present
upper limits on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section of the order
of $10^{-24} \mathrm{cm}^3 \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, as well as lower limits on the
dark matter decay lifetime up to $10^{26} \mathrm{s}$ for dark matter masses
between 5 GeV up to 8 TeV. These results strengthen the current IceCube limits
on dark matter masses above 20 GeV and provide an order of magnitude
improvement at lower masses. In addition, they represent the strongest
constraints from any neutrino telescope on GeV-scale dark matter and are among
the world-leading limits for several dark matter scenarios.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了NGC 1068星系中高能中微子发射的起源机制，提出湍流驱动的磁重联是粒子加速的主要机制，而非漂移加速。模型显示质子通过与光学/紫外光子的光介子相互作用损失能量，解释了观测到的中微子过剩但缺乏伽马射线对应体的现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NGC 1068被IceCube探测到4.2σ显著性的中微子过剩，但缺乏伽马射线对应体。这表明存在强伽马射线吸收和有效的粒子加速机制，需要解释这种特殊的高能中微子发射现象。

Method: 开发了单区模型，基于de Gouveia Dal Pino和Lazarian(2005)以及Kadowaki等人(2015)的框架，研究湍流磁重联在日冕吸积流中的粒子加速过程。模型考虑了强对产生衰减以及与光学、紫外和X射线光子场的相互作用。

Result: 发现粒子加速主要由湍流重联层中的一阶费米加速驱动，而非漂移加速。加速质子主要通过光介子相互作用与光学/紫外背景光子损失能量，受到日冕X射线发射的重要约束。

Conclusion: 湍流驱动的磁重联是解释NGC 1068中高能中微子发射的可行机制，能够解释观测到的中微子过剩和伽马射线缺失现象，强调了日冕X射线发射对质子能量损失过程的重要约束作用。

Abstract: The Seyfert Type II galaxy NGC 1068 has been identified as a potential
neutrino source by IceCube, with a 4.2$\sigma $ significance detection of a
79$^{+22}_{-20}$ neutrino excess from 2011 to 2020, despite the absence of a
gamma-ray counterpart. The observed high-energy neutrino emission indicates the
presence of a hadronic component, along with strong gamma-ray absorption,
likely via pair production, and efficient particle acceleration. In this work,
we investigate turbulence-driven magnetic reconnection as a mechanism for
particle acceleration in the coronal accretion flow surrounding the central
black hole. We develop a one-zone model for both acceleration and emission,
following the framework of de Gouveia Dal Pino and Lazarian (2005) and Kadowaki
et al. (2015) to explore how fast magnetic reconnection in the inner coronal
disk region accelerates protons and electrons, shaping the spectral energy
distribution (SED). Our model incorporates strong pair production attenuation
and interactions with optical, ultraviolet (OUV), and X-ray photon fields in
the corona, which serve as effective targets for proton interactions. Unlike
recent studies, we find that particle acceleration to the extreme energies
required to explain observations is primarily driven by first-order Fermi
acceleration within the turbulent reconnection layers in a large scale current
sheet, rather than by drift acceleration. Additionally, we demonstrate that
accelerated protons primarily lose energy through photopion interactions with
the OUV background, subject to important constraints from the coronal X-ray
emission.

Abstract: Pulsar-like objects are extremely compact, with an average density that
exceeds nuclear saturation density, where the fundamental strong interaction
plays an essential role, particularly in the low-energy regime. The internal
structures and properties of those objects are profoundly connected to
phenomena such as supernova explosions, gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts,
high/low-mass compact stars, and even to issues like dark matter and cosmic
rays. However, due to the non-perturbative nature of quantum chromodynamics,
significant uncertainties remain in our current understanding of the
composition and equation of state (EOS) for the dense matter inside them.
Drawing on three-flavour symmetry and the strong coupling between light quarks,
this paper presents a novel perspective on the nature of pulsars: they are
actually composed of strange matter, in the form of either strange quark matter
or strangeon (analogous to nucleons and representing multibaryon states with
three-flavour symmetry) matter. As both strange quark matter and strangeon
matter contain non-zero strangeness, we refer to them collectively as ``strange
matter'', and to the corresponding compact stars as ``strange stars''. We then
briefly introduce several physical models describing strange matter and present
the resulting structures and properties of strange stars. This includes
discussions on the EOSs, surface properties, mass-radius relations, glitches,
binary compact star mergers, and dark matter. Furthermore, we will explore how
observational properties of pulsar-like objects support the strange star model.

Motivation: 探索高能中微子与活动星系核耀斑之间的关联，特别是考虑中微子可能相对于电磁辐射存在时间延迟的情况。

Method: 使用IceCat-1中微子目录与MOJAVE和CGRaBS数据库中的活动星系核进行交叉匹配，利用Fermi-LAT光变曲线，扫描不同时间延迟参数。

Result: 在约10^3天的延迟时间处发现了一个约2σ的相关性，但经过多重检验校正后p值约为0.1，与零假设一致。

Conclusion: 虽然发现了微弱的相关性信号，但统计显著性不足以确认中微子与耀变体耀斑之间存在明确关联。

Abstract: We report the results of the search for the high-energy neutrino emission
associated with blazar flares, accounting for a possible lag of neutrinos with
respect to the electromagnetic emission, either due to the slowness of the
proton energy losses in $p\gamma$ collisions and/or proton acceleration. We
perform two tests, cross-matching neutrinos with energies $E_{\nu} \gtrsim
100$~TeV from the public catalogue of neutrino alerts IceCat-1 with active
galactic nuclei from two source samples based on 1) the MOJAVE database and 2)
the CGRaBS catalogue, and utilising Fermi-LAT light curves from the public
light curve repository. We scan over a wide range of values of the jet-frame
time delay $t^{\prime}_{\mathrm{delay}}$ between the neutrino arrival and the
time of the prior major $\gamma$-ray flare and find a pre-trial $\sim 2\sigma$
correlation at $t^{\prime}_{\mathrm{delay}} \sim 10^{3}$ d, which is consistent
($p_{\mathrm{post-trial}} \sim 0.1$) with expectations under the null
hypothesis after trial correction.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该研究重新分析了MWC 656双星系统的性质，通过多波段观测数据挑战了其包含黑洞伴星的解释，支持伴星为白矮星或中子星的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MWC 656最初被认为是包含Be星和黑洞的双星系统，但近期研究对此提出质疑。本研究旨在通过多波段观测数据重新评估该系统的性质。

Method: 使用VLA的射电观测数据（8.0-12.0 GHz）、Gaia卫星的光学天体测量数据以及Fermi-LAT的高能γ射线数据，进行综合分析。

Result: 射电和X射线光度比既符合吸积黑洞的基本平面关系，也符合磁活动恒星的Güdel-Benz关系；光学天体测量显示系统具有11.2±2.3 km/s的特殊速度，排除了逃逸星的可能性；Fermi-LAT数据未检测到显著的γ射线辐射。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持MWC 656的伴星不是黑洞，而更可能是白矮星或中子星等非黑洞致密天体。

Abstract: The binary star MWC 656 was initially proposed as the first confirmed system
composed of a Be star and a black hole. However, recent studies have challenged
this interpretation, suggesting that the compact companion is unlikely to be a
black hole. In this study, we revisit the nature of MWC 656 by analyzing
archival data across multiple wavelengths, including radio observations from
the VLA, optical astrometry from the Gaia satellite, and high-energy
$\gamma$-ray data from the Fermi-LAT. Using all available VLA observations at
X-band (8.0-12.0 GHz), we produce the deepest radio map toward this system to
date, with a noise level of 780 nJy beam$^{-1}$. The source MWC 656 is detected
with $S_\nu=4.6\pm0.8\mu$Jy and a spectral index of $\alpha=1.2\pm1.8$, derived
by sub-band imaging. The radio and X-ray luminosity ratio of MWC 656 is
consistent with both the fundamental plane of accreting black holes and with
the G\"udel-Benz relation for magnetically active stars, leaving the emission
mechanism ambiguous. The optical astrometric results of MWC 656 indicate a
peculiar velocity of $11.2\pm2.3$ km s$^{-1}$, discarding it as a runaway star.
Its current location, 442 pc below the Galactic plane, implies a vertical
travel time incompatible with the lifetime of a B1.5-type star. Moreover, the
agreement between observed and expected motion in all three velocity components
argues against a deceleration scenario, suggesting that MWC 656 likely formed
in situ at high Galactic latitude. We carried out maximum likelihood analysis
of Fermi-LAT data, but cannot report a significant detection of $\gamma$-ray
emission from this source. These results reinforce recent evidence that
challenge the black hole companion interpretation, and favor a non-BH compact
object such as a white dwarf or neutron star.

Conclusion: X射线地球同步辐射发射是PeV能级高海拔间接宇宙射线探测的一个有前景的补充通道。

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of detecting extensive air showers via their
geo-synchrotron X-ray emission from high-altitude platforms. Starting from
first principles, we derive a differential expression for the number of emitted
photons per unit grammage and photon energy for an ensemble of gyrating shower
electrons. The calculation uses noted parameterizations of the electron state
variable distributions in the shower to establish a scale for the photon
footprint and, further, takes into account the propagation of emitted photons
in the atmosphere. The computed fluxes at the position of the detector are used
to estimate the detector acceptance and event rate using a bootstrap Monte
Carlo procedure. For a 1 m radius and 70{\deg} half-aperture circular detector
at an altitude between 20 to 30 km viewing the Earth's limb, we find
acceptances at the 1 $\mathrm{m^2 sr}$ level and integral event rates of
roughly 10 per month. These results indicate that X-ray geo-synchrotron
emission is a promising, complimentary channel for high-altitude indirect
cosmic ray detection in the PeV regime.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 扩散激波加速理论预测高能粒子分布呈幂律谱，但该特性并非理论固有。研究表明，在倾斜磁场平面激波中，幂律谱的生成需要粒子散射率与回旋半径成正比且空间均匀。非Bohm标度会导致倾斜激波产生弯曲谱，而上游散射空间分布的突变会引入谱断裂。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索扩散激波加速理论中幂律谱生成的精确条件，特别是倾斜磁场和散射率空间分布对粒子能谱形态的影响。

Method: 使用公开代码Sapphire++进行数值模拟，分析不同散射标度和空间分布条件下粒子能谱的变化。

Result: 发现非Bohm标度散射在倾斜激波中产生弯曲谱，上游散射空间分布的突变导致谱断裂。这些效应在快速激波中尤为显著。

Conclusion: 幂律谱的生成需要严格的Bohm标度散射和空间均匀性条件，实际天体物理环境中的偏离会导致能谱形态的显著变化。

Abstract: A major attraction of diffusive shock acceleration is the prediction of
power-law spectra for energetic particle distributions. However, this property
is not fundamental to the theory. We demonstrate that for planar shocks with an
oblique magnetic field the generation of power-law spectra critically requires
the particles' scattering rate to be both directly proportional to their gyro
radius (Bohm scaling) and spatially uniform. Non-Bohm scaling results in curved
spectra at oblique shocks, while abrupt changes in the spatial profile of the
scattering upstream introduces spectral breaks. Using the publicly available
code Sapphire++, we numerically explore the magnitude of these effects, which
are particularly pronounced at fast shocks, as expected in active galactic
nuclei and microquasar jets, or young supernova remnants.

Abstract: A decrease in the orbital period of the ultrashort-period binary white dwarf
\ZTF, which is one of the Galactic verification binaries in the millihertz
frequency range for planned space laser interferometers, has been measured.
Based on photometric observations carried out on the 2.5-m telescope of the
Caucasian Mountain Observatory of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute of
Moscow State University (CMO SAI MSU), a diagram \textit{O-C} is constructed.
It can be described by quadratic elements of the brightness variation, which
correspond to a decrease rate of the orbital period of the system of
$dP/dt=-(1.16\pm 0.22)\times 10^{-11}$ s/s. The decrease rate of the orbital
period in the quadrupole approximation for the emission of gravitational waves
by a binary system corresponds to its chirp mass $\mathcal{M}=0.434\pm 0.05
M_\odot$, which turned out to be $\sim 30\%$ higher than the value obtained
earlier from spectroscopic mass determination. The chirp mass of \ZTF inferred
from the measured orbital decay rate makes this system the brightest Galactic
verification binary for LISA and TianQin space interferometers with a
signal-to-noise ratio of $\approx 119$ and $\approx 30$ over 5 years and 2.5
years of observations, respectively.

Abstract: The diffuse emission of gamma-rays and neutrinos, produced by interactions of
cosmic rays with interstellar matter in the Milky Way, provides valuable
insights into cosmic ray propagation and Galactic processes. Emission models
incorporating different assumptions about cosmic ray diffusion, source
distribution, and target gas density are tested using data from neutrino
telescopes. In this study, the final all-flavor neutrino dataset, collected
over 15 years (2007--2022) by the ANTARES neutrino telescope, is analyzed. A
maximum likelihood ratio method built to handle templates of Galactic emission
models is employed to evaluate the compatibility of these models with the
observed spatial and energy distributions of neutrino events. The results do
not yield stringent constraints on the tested models and upper limits on the
diffuse neutrino flux are derived, which are compatible with the results
obtained by other experiments.

Abstract: The production sites of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos remain uncertain,
though growing evidence suggests a connection to relativistic jets in active
galactic nuclei (AGN). We present a detailed analysis of the recent PeV
neutrino event KM3-230213A reported by the KM3NeT collaboration, aiming to
constrain the physical conditions of its source. Assuming proton acceleration
at shocks, we derive the properties of the proton distribution and the
energetics required to explain the neutrino emission. Using contemporaneous
multiwavelength observations of three AGN flaring candidates within the error
region, we examine the plausibility of each of them as the possible
counterpart. Our results favor PMN J0606-0724, which exhibits a prominent radio
flare coincident with the neutrino arrival. In this framework, the red-giant
interaction remains the key driver of baryon injection and shock acceleration,
while the dominant external photon field sets the neutrino energy scale:
photospheric photons from the red giant yield ~1-10 PeV neutrinos, whereas the
~220 PeV event KM3-230213A is more naturally produced through interactions with
colder infrared photons from the dusty torus.

Abstract: The equation of state of dense matter remains a central challenge in
astrophysics and high-energy physics, particularly at supra-nuclear densities
where exotic degrees of freedom like hyperons or deconfined quarks are expected
to appear. Neutron stars provide a unique natural laboratory to probe this
regime. In this work, we present EVA--01, a novel equation of state that
provides a unified description of dense matter by incorporating both hadron and
quark degrees of freedom within a single relativistic mean-field Lagrangian,
from which the equation of state is derived at finite temperature. The model
extends the density-dependent formalism by introducing a Polyakov-loop-inspired
scalar field to dynamically govern the hadron-quark phase transition, following
the approach of chiral mean-field models. The resulting model is consistent
with a wide range of theoretical and observational constraints, including those
from chiral effective field theory, massive pulsars, gravitational-wave events,
and NICER data. We analyze its thermodynamic properties by constructing the QCD
phase diagram, identifying the deconfinement, chiral, and nuclear liquid-gas
transitions. As a first application, we model the evolution of proto-neutron
stars using isentropic snapshots and explore the implications of the slow
stable hybrid star hypothesis. Our findings establish EVA--01 as a robust and
versatile framework for exploring dense matter, bridging the gap between
microphysical models and multimessenger astrophysical observations.
