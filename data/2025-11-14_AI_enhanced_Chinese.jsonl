The TAIGA experiment is a hybrid detector system that combines several imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and an array of non-imaging Cherenkov detectors (TAIGA-HiSCORE) for EAS detection. Because the signals recorded by different detector types differ in physical nature, the direct merging of data is unfeasible, which complicates multimodal analysis. Currently, to analyze data from the IACTs and TAIGA-HiSCORE, a set of auxiliary parameters specific to each detector type is calculated from the recorded signals. These parameters are chosen empirically, so there is no certainty that they retain all important information and are the best suited for the respective problems. We propose to use autoencoders (AE) for the analysis of TAIGA experimental data and replace the conventionally used auxiliary parameters with the parameters of the AE latent space. The advantage of the AE latent space parameters is that they preserve essential physics from experimental data without prior assumptions. This approach also holds potential for enabling seamless integration of heterogeneous IACT and HiSCORE data through a joint latent space. To reconstruct the parameters of the primary particle of the EAS from the latent space of the AE, a separate artificial neural network is used. In this paper, the proposed approach is used to reconstruct the energy of the EAS primary particles based on Monte Carlo simulation data for TAIGA-HiSCORE. The dependence of the energy determination accuracy on the dimensionality of the latent space is analyzed, and these results are also compared with the results obtained by the conventional technique. It is shown that when using the AE latent space, the energy of the primary particle is reconstructed with satisfactory accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(AE)\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u53c2\u6570\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7ecf\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eTAIGA\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u5e7f\u5ef6\u5927\u6c14\u7c07\u5c04(EAS)\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u548c\u521d\u7ea7\u7c92\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "TAIGA\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5207\u4f26\u79d1\u592b\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4fe1\u53f7\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5408\u5e76\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4fdd\u7559\u6240\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ece\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u5efaEAS\u521d\u7ea7\u7c92\u5b50\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eTAIGA-HiSCORE\u7684\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u80fd\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u4f7f\u7528AE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\uff0c\u521d\u7ea7\u7c92\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4ee4\u4eba\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u80fd\u91cf\u786e\u5b9a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "AE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u53c2\u6570\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u7559\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784IACT\u548cHiSCORE\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

As one of its key payloads, the Low-energy Polarization Detector (LPD) is designed to perform wide-field surveys to capture X-ray polarization information from gamma-ray bursts in the 2-10 keV energy range. This paper presents Topmetal-L, a dedicated charge-sensitive pixel sensor developed for the LPD prototype upgrade. Fabricated in a 130 nm CMOS process in 2024, the chip integrates a 356 $\\times$ 512 pixel array with a pixel pitch of 45 $\u03bc$m. Each pixel incorporates a 26 $\\times$ 26 $\u03bc$m^2 charge-collecting electrode window and is capable of simultaneously outputting both energy and position information of deposited charges. Topmetal-L has been systematically optimized for power consumption, noise performance, and readout efficiency.

Comments encouraged!", "summary": "Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGN) feature order-of-magnitude variability in both the continuum and broad line luminosities on months-to-years long timescales, and are currently unexplained. Simulations have demonstrated that rotating black holes sometimes tear apart tilted accretion disks. These tearing events violently restructure the disk on timescales much shorter than a viscous timescale, hinting at a connection to CLAGN. Here, we show that disk tearing can power changing-look events. We report synthetic observations of an extremely high resolution three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thin, tilted accretion disk around a rapidly rotating, $10^8\\,M_\\odot$ black hole. We perform ray-tracing calculations that follow the disk light to both a line of sight camera and to a distribution of cameras in a prescribed torus-like broad line region. The continuum photoionizes the broad line region and we calculate the resulting spectrum. Both the continuum and line luminosities undergo order of magnitude swings on months-to-years long timescales. We find shorter, weeks long variability driven by the geometric precession of the inner disk and an intraday quasi-periodic oscillation driven by radial breathing of the inner disk. When the torn disk precesses, it causes asymmetric illumination of the broad line region, driving time-evolving red-to-blue asymmetries of the broad emission lines that may be a smoking gun for disk tearing. We also make predictions for future photometric observations from ULTRASAT and Vera Rubin Observatory, both of which may play an important role in detecting future changing-look events.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These objects emit radio pulses similar to those of pulsars, but at much longer periods -- on the order of minutes to hours. With duty cycles of only a few percent, individual pulses have been observed to last between 10 and 1000 seconds. This places LPTs in a timescale gap between the two main techniques used in transient radio searches: time-series analysis at millisecond to second timescales, and image-plane searches sensitive to variability on the scale of days. As a result, LPTs remained undetected until recently, and only a handful are currently known. To increase the sample of known LPTs, we conducted a dedicated search using 200 hours of archival data from the ASKAP Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey, covering 750 deg$^2$ of sky at the shortest possible imaging time step of 10-seconds. This represents the first large-scale search using ASKAP data at second-scale resolution. Although no LPTs were detected, we identified flares from six stars, at least one had never been detected in the radio regime before. We placed a lower limit on the transient surface density of $2.21\\times10^{-6}$ deg$^{-2}$ at a 10-second timescale, with a sensitivity of 16.9 mJy.

However, achieving accurate null depth calibration is challenging due to various noise sources, instrumental imperfections, and the complexity of real observational environments. These challenges necessitate advanced calibration techniques that can efficiently handle such uncertainties while maintaining a high accuracy. This paper aims to incorporate machine-learning techniques with a Bayesian inference to improve the accuracy and efficiency of null depth retrieval in nulling interferometry. Specifically, it explores the use of neural posterior estimation (NPE) to develop models that overcome the computational limitations of conventional methods, such as numerical self-calibration (NSC), providing a more robust solution for accurate null depth calibration. An NPE-based model was developed, with a simulator that incorporates real data to better represent specific conditions. The model was tested on both synthetic and observational data from the LBTI nuller for evaluation. The NPE model successfully demonstrated improved efficiency, achieving results comparable to current methods in use. It achieved a null depth retrieval accuracy down to a few $10^{-4}$ on real observational data, matching the performance of conventional approaches while offering significant computational advantages, reducing the data retrieval time to one-quarter of the time required by self-calibration methods.

We interpret these phenomena with a unified scenario in which a stellar mass black hole accretes from a massive, misaligned debris disk and launches a magnetically dominated, precessing, structured (spine sheath) jet. The engine clock arises from Lense Thirring precession of the outer annulus of a geometrically thick inner torus at radius r ~ 250 to 300 gravitational radii, while the hard spectra reflect magnetic reconnection dissipation in the spine.

Furthermore, if the barycenter of the pair follows an eccentric orbit around an AGN, then space-borne gravitational wave detectors can measure the density of the surrounding disk with multi-year observations by tracking the gravitational wave evolution. The error between the inferred density profile and the injected truth can be constrained to below $2\\times10^{-11}\\rm g/cm^3$.

Two major gamma-ray flares have been observed during the Fermi era: one in January 2011 and other in June 2019. During these events, CGRaBS J0211+1051 was also bright in other energy bands. On the other hand, there are also examples of optical activity that do not exhibit any comparable gamma-ray variability. Here, we study the temporal and spectral characteristics of the object in an attempt to understand the emission mechanisms operating in this source. A peculiar feature in its spectrum is the X-ray domain, which is unusually soft considering its object class. Interestingly, the relatively soft UV and optical spectrum does not extrapolate well to the X-rays. To mimic the observed SEDs during quiescent and flaring periods, we use both a purely leptonic and a hadro-leptonic modeling approach to reproduce four broadband SEDs from various epochs. When taking into account the steep optical-UV spectrum, we find that the hadro-leptonic scenarios better explains the SEDs compared to the purely leptonic model.

The mission ended after 36 h due to a balloon leak that resulted in the payload being lost in the Pacific Ocean. Over the course of the mission, the onboard Cherenkov Telescope (CT) was pointed just below the Earth's limb to search for optical signals from upward-moving extensive air showers that were induced by decaying tau-leptons that were generated by the conversion of $>10$ PeV tau-neutrinos in Earth. Such very-high energy (VHE) neutrinos may be produced in several classes of astrophysical sources that are suspected of possibly accelerating particles to ultra-high energies. In this contribution, we discuss the EUSO-SPB2 Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) campaign to search for VHE neutrino signals coming from astrophysical sources that crossed the CT's field of view ($6.4^\\circ \\times 12.8^\\circ$). We also present a new software tool designed for scheduling observations, the Neutrino Target Scheduler, that we developed to support the ToO campaign. We also calculate upper limits on the neutrino fluences from sources observed during the ToO campaign.

Comments more than welcome!", "summary": "X-ray binaries exhibit complex variability patterns studied in the power-spectrum. These include the broad-band noise (BBN) components and various types of narrow components called quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). There is currently no consensus about either what determines the presence/absence of the BBN or what generates the QPOs. Many believe the latter is due to frame-dragging effects caused by Lense-Thirring torques. We wish to investigate the potential impact of those frame-dragging effects on the accretion disk itself. In particular, we focus on its impact on the observed variability and the presence (and types) of QPOs associated. We make analytical estimates to assess the potential presence of a geometric warp in the inner accretion disk during state transitions. We show that the presence of a warp can modify the spectral-timing properties in a way that matches the observed transition between QPO types during outbursts. We also discuss the peculiar case of Cyg X-1, as well as how the hard-to-soft transition could be driven by the warp itself. The (expected) emergence of a warp provides a consistent explanation for the evolution of both the BBN and the QPO properties during state transitions.

Submitted to ApJL", "summary": "We present 15 years of Nan\u00e7ay and Green Bank radio telescope timing observations for PSR J1231$-$1411. This millisecond pulsar is a primary science target for the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer telescope (NICER, which discovered its X-ray pulsations), has accumulated near-continuous $\u03b3$-ray data since the Fermi-Large Area Telescope's launch, and has been studied extensively with the Green Bank and Nan\u00e7ay radio telescopes. We have undertaken a campaign with the Green Bank Telescope targeting specific orbital phases designed to improve our constraint on the pulsar's mass through the detection of a relativistic Shapiro delay. Both frequentist and Bayesian techniques -- the latter incorporating priors from white dwarf binary evolution models -- are applied to fifteen years of radio observations, yielding relatively weak constraints on the companion and pulsar masses of $0.23^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and $1.87^{+1.11}_{-0.67}$ M$_{\\odot}$, respectively (68.3% CI from Bayesian fits); however, the orbital inclination is measured to better relative precision ($79.80^{+3.47}_{-4.70}$ degrees). Restricting the maximum allowed pulsar mass to 3 M$_{\\odot}$ while simultaneously sampling the noise and timing models improves the constraint and lowers the measured mass to $1.62^{+0.73}_{-0.58}$ M$_{\\odot}$. While our radio-derived inclination result has informed recent NICER X-ray studies of PSR J1231$-$1411, the lessons learned from this troublesome pulsar will also bolster future high-precision mass measurement campaigns and resulting constraints on the neutron star interior equation of state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9PSR J1231-1411\u8109\u51b2\u661f15\u5e74\u7684\u5c04\u7535\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u590f\u76ae\u7f57\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6548\u5e94\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u7ea6\u675f\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3aNICER X\u5c04\u7ebf\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c04\u7535\u89c2\u6d4b\u63a2\u6d4b\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u590f\u76ae\u7f57\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u6beb\u79d2\u8109\u51b2\u661fPSR J1231-1411\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Nan\u00e7ay\u548cGreen Bank\u5c04\u7535\u671b\u8fdc\u955c15\u5e74\u7684\u8ba1\u65f6\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9891\u7387\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u53cc\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u8f68\u9053\u76f8\u4f4d\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u4f34\u661f\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\uff1a0.23^{+0.09}_{-0.06} M\u2299\u548c1.87^{+1.11}_{-0.67} M\u2299\uff0c\u8f68\u9053\u503e\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\u4e3a79.80^{+3.47}_{-4.70}\u5ea6\u3002\u9650\u5236\u6700\u5927\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3a3 M\u2299\u65f6\uff0c\u6d4b\u5f97\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3a1.62^{+0.73}_{-0.58} M\u2299\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u8d28\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u4f46\u8f68\u9053\u503e\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u5df2\u4e3aNICER X\u5c04\u7ebf\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u8be5\u56f0\u96be\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d3b\u52a8\u548c\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

Machine-readable versions of the maps and spectra are available on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/17570420", "summary": "Microquasars have emerged as promising candidates to explain the cosmic-ray flux at petaelectronvolt energies. LHAASO observations revealed V4641~Sgr as the most extreme example so far. Using $\\approx$100~h of H.E.S.S. data, we performed a spectro-morphological study of the gamma-ray emission around V4641~Sgr. We employed HI and dedicated CO observations of the region to infer the target material for cosmic-ray interactions. We detected multi-TeV emission around V4641~Sgr with a high significance. The emission region is elongated. We found a power-law spectrum with an index $\\approx$1.8, and together with results from other gamma-ray instruments, this reveals a spectral energy distribution that peaks at energies of $\\approx$100~TeV for the first time. We found indications (3$\u03c3$) of a two-component morphology, with indistinguishable spectral properties. The position of V4641~Sgr is inconsistent with the best-fit position of the single-component model and with the dip between the two components. We found no significant evidence of an energy-dependent morphology. No dense gas was found at any distance towards V4641~Sgr. The peak of the SED at $\\approx$100~TeV identifies V4641~Sgr as a candidate cosmic-ray accelerator beyond the so-called knee. The absence of dense target gas places stringent energetic constraints on hadronic interpretations, however. The H.E.S.S. measurement requires an unusually hard ($\\approx 1.5$) spectral index for the protons. A leptonic scenario faces fewer obstacles if the particle transport is fast enough to avoid losses and to reproduce the observed energy-independent morphology. The absence of bright \\xray emission across the gamma-ray emission region requires a magnetic field strength $\\lesssim3$~$\u03bc$G, however. Our findings favour a leptonic origin of the gamma-ray emission.

This study examines the cosmogenic gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes resulting from UHECR propagation in starburst galaxies with supernova remnants, with a particular focus on NGC 1068, a well-established high-energy neutrino source. Using extragalactic simulations, we calculate the upper limit on cosmic-ray luminosity, applying upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes derived from observations by H.E.S.S. and MAGIC observatories. Our analysis incorporates the effects of both extragalactic and galactic magnetic fields on particle propagation, constraining the maximum extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF) intensity to $10^{-14}~\\mathrm{G}$ to ensure that at least 90\\% of injected UHECRs successfully reach Earth. The results provide upper limits on gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes, estimates of UHECR luminosity for individual sources, and predictions for the detection capabilities of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory regarding gamma-ray emission from NGC 1068.
