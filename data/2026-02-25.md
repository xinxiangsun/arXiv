*Noah E. Wolfe,Matthew Mould,John Veitch,Salvatore Vitale*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 使用变分神经后验估计实现引力波数据的贝叶斯顺序更新，无需重新分析历史数据即可更新黑洞双星群体模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着引力波目录增长，完整分析计算成本急剧增加，特别是使用高维灵活模型推断天体物理源群体时。需要一种能够随着新数据到来而更新知识的方法，而无需重新分析现有数据。

Method: 采用变分神经后验估计方法，实现引力波数据的贝叶斯顺序更新。测试了三种更新节奏：新目录更新、逐月更新和逐信号更新。研究了神经顺序更新的成功和失败模式。

Result: 更新稳健性对每次更新包含的信息量敏感，使用较大数据段进行更新时效果最佳。该方法能够识别对群体具有单独信息价值的事件，并为联合分析提供高效似然表示。

Conclusion: 神经贝叶斯更新为天体物理群体模型提供了高效的数据更新方法，可用于标准警报宇宙学等联合分析，类似方法也可用于贝叶斯随机背景搜索。

Abstract: As gravitational-wave catalogs grow, they will become increasingly computationally expensive to analyze in their entirety, especially when inferring astrophysical source populations with high-dimensional, flexible models. Bayesian statistics offers a natural remedy, letting us update our knowledge of physical models as new data arrive, without re-analyzing existing data. However, doing so requires the posterior probability density of model parameters for previous observations, which is typically intractable. Here, we use variational neural posterior estimation to rapidly update the inferred population of binary black holes as data are observed in gravitational-wave detectors. We apply this approach to real and simulated catalogs analyzed with both low- and high-dimensional population models, testing the reliability of three update cadences: with new catalogs of sources, month by month during an observing run, and as each new signal arrives. We investigate the success and failure modes of neural sequential updates, finding that the robustness of updating is sensitive to the information contained in each update and that updating is most effective when performed with larger segments of data. We outline one additional scientific application enabled by Bayesian updating: identification of events that are individually informative about the population. Neural Bayesian updates to astrophysical population models also provide efficient likelihood representations for joint analyses with other data, e.g., standard-siren cosmology, and similar methods can be used to perform Bayesian stochastic background searches.

### [2] [Compute System Organization for High Frequency High Order Wavefront Sensing and Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20298)
*Barry Lyu,Vaibhavi Manjarekar,Nathaniel Bleier*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 论文提出将HWO的高阶波前传感与控制计算任务卸载到L2点的协同飞行计算卫星上，以解决当前星载硬件计算能力不足的问题，实现更高的控制频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HWO需要达到10^{-10}的对比度，需要连续进行暗区维护，但现有辐射硬化星载处理器的计算能力无法满足LUVOIR规模的高阶波前传感与控制需求，存在显著的计算能力缺口。

Method: 提出将HOWFSC计算流水线卸载到日地L2点的专用协同飞行计算卫星上，使用现代辐射耐受的高性能处理器，评估商业硬件平台性能，并提出定制架构以实现更高控制频率和更低功耗。

Result: 该架构可将端到端控制频率从典型的亚赫兹（辐射硬化星载处理或地面闭环操作）提升到数十甚至数百赫兹，同时显著降低功耗。

Conclusion: 协同飞行计算架构能够弥补HOWFSC计算需求与当前星载硬件能力之间的差距，提高控制频率，同时降低主观测站风险，需要进一步考虑可靠性、卫星集成和星间通信等系统级问题。

Abstract: Maintaining long-term wavefront stability is critical for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), which targets contrasts approaching $10^{-10}$ and therefore requires continuous dark-zone maintenance using high-order wavefront sensing and control (HOWFSC). Prior work has advanced HOWFSC algorithms and profiled candidate implementations on radiation-hardened processors, highlighting a substantial gap between the computational demands of LUVOIR-scale HOWFSC and the capabilities of current onboard spacecraft hardware. In this paper, we argue that this gap can be closed by offloading the HOWFSC pipeline to a dedicated co-flying compute satellite at Sun-Earth L2. This approach enables the use of modern, radiation-tolerant high-performance processors without increasing risk to the primary observatory. We show that such an architecture can increase the end-to-end control cadence from the sub-hertz regime typical of radiation-hardened onboard processing or ground-in-the-loop operation to tens and even hundreds of hertz. We evaluate commercial hardware platforms in terms of performance and feasibility, and we propose custom architectures that enable higher control frequencies with significant power consumption reductions. Finally, we outline system-level considerations for co-flying compute, including reliability, satellite integration, and inter-satellite communication constraints.

Method: 采用历史回顾的方法，按时间顺序描述天文台太阳观测设施的建设和发展，包括不同时期建造的圆顶、光谱仪和其他观测设备。

Result: 详细呈现了比利牛斯山天文台从1930年代到1960年代太阳观测设施的完整发展历程：从Lyot的日冕仪开始，到专门的光球层/色球层观测设备，再到国际地球物理年期间建立的光谱实验室，最后到1960年代观测设施的进一步专业化和基础设施革命。

Conclusion: 比利牛斯山天文台在太阳观测领域经历了持续的技术发展和设施专业化过程，从最初的多功能设备发展到专门化的观测系统，为太阳物理学研究提供了重要的技术平台。

Abstract: Observations of the solar corona at the Pic du Midi began with Bernard Lyot and his spectro coronagraph installed on the multi-purpose equatorial mount of the Baillaud cupola. It was not until 1956 that domes and instruments specifically dedicated to observations of the photosphere and the solar chromosphere appeared. On the occasion of the International Geophysical Year, a solar spectroscopy laboratory was created to the west of the Pic du Midi, based on two spectrographs of 4 m and 9 m focal length. In 1961 the turret dome appeared to the east of the Pic, later equipped with an 8 m spectrograph. Around 1965, the Baillaud dome finally specialized in the corona with a new table and new spectrographs. At the same time, a revolution in infrastructure took place at the Pic in a few years, which we present as well as the solar spectrographs and their goal.

TL;DR: 提出基于小波分解的F10.7指数预测新方法，结合iTransformer模型，显著提升预测性能并优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有F10.7指数预测方法性能有限，需要开发更准确可靠的预测技术来支持空间天气预报

Method: 使用小波分解将F10.7指数分解为近似和细节信号，与原始信号一起输入iTransformer模型；同时评估国际太阳黑子数及其小波分解信号的影响

Result: 小波组合方法显著优于仅使用F10.7基线的预测；Combination 6方法比S. Yan等人(2025)和三个业务模型的RMSE、MAE、MAPE分别降低18.22%、15.09%、8.57%；在PatchTST模型上也优于H. Ye等人(2024)的方法

Conclusion: 小波分解首次成功应用于F10.7预测，显著提高了预测性能，为空间天气预报提供了更可靠的工具

Abstract: In this study, we construct Dataset A for training, validation, and testing, and Dataset B to evaluate generalization. We propose a novel F10.7 index forecasting method using wavelet decomposition, which feeds F10.7 together with its decomposed approximate and detail signals into the iTransformer model. We also incorporate the International Sunspot Number (ISN) and its wavelet-decomposed signals to assess their influence on prediction performance. Our optimal method is then compared with the latest method from S. Yan et al. (2025) and three operational models (SWPC, BGS, CLS). Additionally, we transfer our method to the PatchTST model used in H. Ye et al. (2024) and compare our method with theirs on Dataset B. Key findings include: (1) The wavelet-based combination methods overall outperform the baseline using only F10.7 index. The prediction performance improves as higher-level approximate and detail signals are incrementally added. The Combination 6 method integrating F10.7 with its first to fifth level approximate and detail signals outperforms methods using only approximate or detail signals. (2) Incorporating ISN and its wavelet-decomposed signals does not enhance prediction performance. (3) The Combination 6 method significantly surpasses S. Yan et al. (2025) and three operational models, with RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 18.22%, 15.09%, and 8.57%, respectively, against the former method. It also excels across four different conditions of solar activity. (4) Our method demonstrates superior generalization and prediction capability over the method of H. Ye et al. (2024) across all forecast horizons. To our knowledge, this is the first application of wavelet decomposition in F10.7 prediction, substantially improving forecast performance.

TL;DR: 开发了盖亚太空望远镜的半解析PSF模型，解决了漂移扫描模式引起的系统畸变，显著改善了观测建模，已应用于DR4数据处理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盖亚望远镜采用漂移扫描和时间延迟积分模式，导致PSF存在独特的系统性和周期性畸变，这些畸变包括恒星图像漂移率与电荷转移率的系统变化，以及CCD响应的空间变化，必须纳入PSF模型以减少数据产品的系统误差

Method: 开发了半解析PSF模型：沿扫描和跨扫描方向的恒星图像运动模糊效应采用解析建模，PSF形状对源颜色和CCD内位置的依赖性通过经验校准，引入PSF原点约束以打破与几何仪器校准的简并性

Result: 新PSF模型显著改善了观测建模，特别是在G波段11-13星等范围内，有助于减少导出数据产品的天体测量和光度测量不确定性，模型已部署于盖亚循环数据处理系统并用于DR4生产

Conclusion: 盖亚PSF的线性部分现已得到很好理解，未来工作将聚焦于处理依赖于信号水平的非线性效应，如电荷转移效率不足和亮星变胖效应，该工作为盖亚数据用户和其他采用相同观测原理的任务提供了有用参考

Abstract: An accurate model of the point spread function is required in order to estimate positions and brightnesses of stars in digitized images. The PSF of the Gaia space telescope is unusual due to the use of drift-scan mode and time-delayed integration, in which the satellite spins and precesses while images are captured. This induces several systematic and periodic distortions in the PSF that are unique to Gaia. These include systematic variations in the stellar image drift rate with respect to the charge transfer rate, and spatial variations in the CCD response that are, contrary to expectations, not marginalised by the use of TDI mode. These must be incorporated into the PSF model in order to reduce systematic errors in Gaia's data products.
  We have developed a semi-analytic model of the PSF, in which the blurring effects of along- and across-scan stellar image motion are modelled analytically, and dependences of the PSF shape on source colour and position within the CCD are calibrated empirically. Constraints on the PSF origin are introduced in order to break a degeneracy with the geometric instrument calibration. Our new PSF model leads to significant improvements in the modelling of observations, particularly around the 11-13 magnitude range in G. This will contribute to reductions in the astrometric and photometric uncertainties in the derived data products. Our PSF model was deployed in the Gaia cyclic data processing systems and used in the production of the forthcoming Data Release 4. The linear part of Gaia's PSF is now well understood. Future development work will focus on the handling of several nonlinear effects that depend on the signal level, including charge transfer inefficiency and the brighter-fatter effect. This work will provide a useful reference for users of Gaia data and for other missions that use the same observing principles, such as the proposed GaiaNIR mission.

TL;DR: 对Boomerang脉冲星风云G106.65+2.96的6GHz射电偏振研究，发现新小尺度结构，揭示高度有序的环形磁场，偏振分数接近同步辐射极限，通过法拉第旋转推断磁场强度约50-105μG。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Boomerang脉冲星风云G106.65+2.96的偏振特性，探索其小尺度结构特征和磁场几何形态，理解脉冲星风与环境的相互作用机制。

Method: 使用VLA（甚大阵列）在6GHz波段进行高分辨率射电偏振观测，分析偏振图像和偏振分数，构建简单的3D模型解释法拉第旋转效应。

Result: 发现新的小尺度特征：40''×20''的椭圆核心和2'长的弧形结构；揭示高度有序的环形磁场几何；西北瓣偏振分数达~60%，接近同步辐射极限；通过法拉第旋转推断磁场强度为~50-105μG。

Conclusion: Boomerang脉冲星风云具有复杂的小尺度结构和高度有序的环形磁场，高偏振分数表明显著的同步辐射特性，法拉第旋转效应可用于推断磁场强度，为理解脉冲星风云物理过程提供重要观测依据。

Abstract: We present a radio polarimetric study of the Boomerang pulsar wind nebula G106.65+2.96 with VLA observations at the 6 GHz band. Our high-resolution image discovers new small-scale features in the nebula, including an elliptical core of $40''\times20''$ surrounding the central pulsar and a $2'$-long arc wrapping around the core in the north. The latter shows a clear gap from the core, and it consists of a bright lobe in the northwest and a tongue-like structure in the northeast. These could be resulting from the pulsar wind interaction with the environment. Our polarization measurement reveals a highly ordered magnetic field with toroidal geometry. The small scale features are all highly linearly polarized. In particular, the lobe has a polarization fraction of $\sim$60%, close to the synchrotron limit. This is also much higher than the value measured at a lower frequency, implying significant depolarization. We show that this can be explained by Faraday rotation in the nebula, and we constructed a simple 3D model accordingly to infer a magnetic field strength of $\sim$50-105$μ$G.

### [7] [The origin of isolated millisecond pulsars in globular clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20250)
*Raniere de Menezes*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于动力学电离的模型，成功解释了球状星团中孤立毫秒脉冲星的成因，并通过统计检验证实了该模型的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 球状星团中观测到大量孤立的毫秒脉冲星，这与传统认为毫秒脉冲星通过双星系统回收形成的理论相矛盾，因此需要解释这些孤立天体的起源。

Method: 提出了一个物理驱动的双星遭遇率模型Λ ∝ n a/(σ a_H)，结合了局部恒星密度n、速度弥散σ、双星间距a和Heggie-Hills电离半径a_H。该模型与毫秒脉冲星对伴星的烧蚀效应相结合，预测孤立毫秒脉冲星的比例。

Result: 该模型成功预测了球状星团中孤立毫秒脉冲星的比例，且与观测数据一致。统计检验显示，电离驱动模型比零假设（孤立比例与a_H无关）的可能性高220倍。

Conclusion: 动力学电离是球状星团中产生孤立毫秒脉冲星的主要机制，该框架自然解释了ω Centauri中孤立毫秒脉冲星的过量现象。

Abstract: A significant fraction of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in globular clusters (GCs) are observed as isolated objects, despite the widely accepted scenario in which MSPs are formed through recycling in compact binary systems. The origin of these isolated objects therefore remains an open problem. In this Letter, we propose a physically motivated encounter rate per binary, $Λ\propto n a/(σa_H)$, incorporating the local stellar density $n$, velocity dispersion $σ$, binary separation $a$, and the Heggie--Hills ionization radius $a_H$. Combined with companion ablation by the MSP, this rate successfully predicts the observed fraction of isolated MSPs in GCs, that is $\mathcal{F}_i \proptoΛ\propto a_H^{-1}$, establishing dynamical ionization as the primary channel for producing isolated MSPs. We quantitatively test this model against a null hypothesis in which $\mathcal{F}_i$ is independent of $a_H$, and find that the ionization-driven model is 220 times more likely than the null hypothesis. Our framework naturally explains the observed overabundance of isolated MSPs in $ω$ Centauri and establishes binary ionization as the primary mechanism responsible for the production of isolated MSPs in GCs.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 通过分析Fermi-LAT伽马射线数据，研究银河系中心过剩辐射与暗物质晕三轴性和倾斜度的兼容性，发现GCE形态对暗物质晕形状敏感，更支持三轴倾斜暗物质晕而非恒星晕起源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 银河系观测显示其引力势呈三轴性且相对于银心-太阳轴旋转，暗示暗物质晕可能具有相似性质。研究银河系中心过剩辐射(GCE)的形态是否与三轴暗物质晕兼容，有助于理解GCE的起源。

Method: 使用Fermi-LAT伽马射线观测数据，拟合大量银河系弥散辐射模型，测试GCE形态与三轴暗物质晕的兼容性。考虑非倾斜三轴晕和相对于银盘倾斜的三轴晕，量化晕的三轴性和倾斜度对视线积分湮灭信号的影响。

Result: GCE的光谱和内尖度对暗物质晕的三轴性和倾斜度变化具有鲁棒性。但GCE的整体形态在伽马射线数据中可以区分暗物质晕的不同三轴性和倾斜度选择。GCE更兼容于三轴倾斜暗物质晕起源，而非三轴倾斜恒星晕起源。

Conclusion: 银河系中心过剩辐射的形态分析支持其起源于三轴倾斜暗物质晕，这一结果对理解GCE的起源具有重要意义，表明暗物质晕可能具有与银河系整体引力势相似的三轴性和倾斜特性。

Abstract: Recent studies of Galactic surveys, such as Gaia, have revealed that the Milky Way's gravitational potential comes from a matter distribution that is triaxial and rotated with respect to the Galactic center-Sun axis. This, in turn, could mean that the dark matter halo also shares these properties. In this work, by fitting to the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations, we test the compatibility of the morphology of the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) from dark matter annihilation with a triaxial dark matter halo. In particular, we consider both untilted triaxial halos and halos whose principal axes are tilted with respect to the Galactic disk. In our fits of the Fermi-LAT data, by testing over a large library of galactic diffuse emission models, we quantify how the halo triaxiality and tilt affect the line-of-sight-integrated annihilation signal and, consequently, the preferred GCE spatial templates. We find that the GCE spectrum and inner cuspiness are robust against variations in the triaxiality and tilt of the dark matter halo. However, in terms of its overall morphology, the GCE in the gamma-ray data can discriminate between choices for the dark matter halo's triaxiality and tilt. Finally, we find that the GCE is more compatible with originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of dark matter than originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of stars, a result important for understanding the GCE's origin.

Conclusion: 阿尔文波在各类磁流体湍流中起着核心作用，其波包碰撞是湍流级联的关键机制。即使在强磁场条件下，小尺度上仍会出现强湍流区域。不同类型的磁流体湍流（包括相对论和可压缩情况）都显示出阿尔文波相互作用的普遍重要性。

Abstract: Many astrophysical fluids are magnetized and turbulent. Such fluids can be often described by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In this review, we mainly consider MHD turbulence with a strong mean magnetic field whose energy density is greater than or equal to the local kinetic energy density. In these fluids, the MHD waves, especially Alfvén waves, play a dominant dynamical role. Alfvén waves travel along magnetic field lines and collisions of opposite-traveling Alfvén wave packets are essential for turbulence cascade. We focus on strong turbulence regime, where nonlinear interaction during the collision is sufficiently strong and thus one collision is enough to complete turbulence cascade. We will cover the following types of turbulence. First, we review strong Alfvénic MHD turbulence. If the mean magnetic field is very strong, wave packets move very fast and duration of collision is too short to complete turbulence cascade. Even in this case we will show that strong turbulence regime emerges on a small scale. Second, we will consider small-scale MHD turbulence, where interaction of small-scale variants of Alfvén waves (i.e., whistler waves) is important. Third, we review scaling relations in strong relativistic force-free MHD turbulence, where interaction of relativistic Alfvén waves is important. Finally, we briefly discuss scaling relations in compressible MHD turbulence, where interaction of Alfvén waves is still important.

Motivation: 分数电荷粒子(FCPs)是超出标准模型理论的预测粒子，现有研究主要关注重质量类轻子FCPs，但对亚MeV质量范围的轻质量FCPs(LFCPs)研究较少

Method: 使用暗物质粒子探测卫星(DAMPE)十年在轨观测数据，搜索电荷为2/3e的轻质量分数电荷粒子

Result: 未观测到LFCP候选事例，对于质量为0.511 MeV/c²、电荷为2/3e的LFCPs，在90%置信水平下通量上限为5.0×10⁻¹¹ cm⁻²sr⁻¹s⁻¹

Conclusion: 首次利用DAMPE卫星数据对轻质量分数电荷粒子进行系统搜索，为亚MeV质量范围的FCPs研究提供了重要的通量限制

Abstract: Free Fractionally Charged Particles (FCPs) are predicted by some theories beyond or extended to the standard model. FCPs have been widely searched for by underground and space-based experiments based on the assumption of heavy lepton-like particles. However, there is a paucity of research focusing on light-mass FCPs (LFCPs) in the sub-MeV mass range. In this work, we report the LFCPs in primary high energy cosmic rays, based on observational data from the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) satellite. This study utilized ten years on-orbit data of DAMPE to search for LFCPs with a charge of $\frac{2}{3}~e$. No LFCP candidate was observed. Upper flux limit of LFCPs with a mass of 0.511 MeV$/c^{2}$ and a charge of $\frac{2}{3}~e$ is determined to be $\rm 5.0 \times 10^{-11}\,cm^{-2}sr^{-1}s^{-1}$ at the $\rm 90\%$ confidence level.

Result: 该源在250天内流量密度增加20倍，1000多天后仍可探测；光谱演化符合同步辐射特征；位于红移0.116的恒星形成星系中，峰值射电光度约10^39 erg/s

Conclusion: 该源最可能是孤立长伽马暴余辉的晚期阶段，或是中等质量黑洞的潮汐瓦解事件，这两种现象的射电发现都极为罕见

Abstract: We report the discovery of a slowly evolving, extragalactic radio transient, ASKAP J005512.2--255834 (hereafter ASKAP J0055-2558), identified using the Australian SKA Pathfinder in a search for orphan afterglows associated with archival gravitational wave events. Although discovered in this context, there is no evidence that the transient is associated with any known gravitational wave event. Nonetheless, this source exhibits a 20-fold increase in flux density over $<250$ days, and it remains in a declining, detectable state more than 1000 days after the initial detection. Follow-up observations from 0.3 to 9 GHz reveal an evolving spectrum consistent with synchrotron emission. ASKAP J0055-2558 is spatially coincident with a low-mass, star-forming galaxy at redshift $z = 0.116$ ($d_{\rm L}$= 543 Mpc), placing its peak radio luminosity at $νL_ν\sim 10^{39}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Analysis of its radio light curve, inferred blastwave velocity, energetics, host galaxy properties and the absence of counterparts at other wavelengths suggest that ASKAP J0055-2558 is most consistent with either the late-time phase of an orphan long gamma-ray burst afterglow or a tidal disruption event involving an intermediate-mass black hole spatially offset from the galaxy nucleus. The radio discovery of either of these phenomena is extremely rare, with only a few or no confirmed examples to date.

Motivation: 快速蓝色光学暂现源（FBOTs）是极其奇特的天体物理暂现源，在X射线、光学和射电波段都有异常强烈的辐射。其物理起源存在激烈争议，可能的解释包括恒星爆炸和潮汐瓦解事件（TDE）。

Method: 观测最亮的FBOT源AT 2024wpp，分析其峰值后X射线再增亮和光学平台期的演化特征，发现其符合TDE的t^{-5/3}衰减规律。通过X射线谱指数硬化和发射线检测推断出流存在，并对光度演化进行详细建模。

Result: AT 2024wpp的演化特征支持中心致密天体吸积供能机制，详细建模表明最可能的情况是34M⊙沃尔夫-拉叶星与15M⊙黑洞并合爆炸，证明某些FBOTs可能与恒星黑洞的潮汐瓦解事件相关。

Conclusion: AT 2024wpp的观测证据表明，一些FBOTs可能是由恒星黑洞的潮汐瓦解事件产生的，这为理解这类奇特暂现源的物理起源提供了重要线索。

Abstract: Fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) represent one of the most exotic astrophysical transients, exhibiting unusually strong emission across X-ray, optical, and radio wavelengths. Their physical origins remain highly debated, with proposed explanations ranging from stellar explosion to tidal disruption event (TDE). Here we report observations of the most luminous FBOT, AT 2024wpp whose post-peak luminosity rebrightens in X ray and becomes flattening in optical in a manner follows the decay rate characteristic of TDEs ($L_{\rm bol} \propto t^{-5/3}$). This invokes energy contribution of accretion by a central compact object, getting further corroborations from hardening of X-ray spectral index and detection of outflow inferred from the emission lines at similar phase. Detailed modeling of luminsoity evolution favors a coalesce explosion of a 34 M$_{\odot}$ Wolf-Rayet star with a 15 M$_{\odot}$ black hole (BH), demonstrating that some FBOTs may be associated with TDE of a stellar blackhole.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证活动星系核厘米波核心区是否满足粒子与磁场能量均分假设，这对喷流物理和VLBI天体测量精度有重要意义

Method: 使用VLBI全球观测系统(VGOS)对类星体1803+784进行3-11GHz同步宽带全偏振观测，通过专用校准管道处理数据，进行模型拟合和多频率成像分析，测量频率依赖的核心偏移并绘制谱指数和旋转量分布图

Result: 核心偏移幂律指数kr=0.73±0.12/-0.19，显著偏离能量均分预期值kr=1；法拉第旋转可分解为内部成分(RM_I=121±8 rad m^-2)和外部成分(RM_E=-44±9 rad m^-2)

Conclusion: VGOS在紧凑AGN喷流同步多频率偏振研究中具有强大能力，需要在喷流天体物理和大地测量VLBI中考虑非均分效应

Abstract: Context. Compact jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) are commonly assumed to be in equipartition between particle and magnetic-field energy densities at the regions where the radio emission dominates at centimetre wavelengths. This assumption has significant implications for both jet physics and the accuracy of VLBI-based astrometry and geodesy.
  Aims. We tested the validity of the energy equipartition hypothesis in AGN cores at centimetre wavelengths by analysing the blazar 1803+784 using simultaneous broadband full-polarization observations with the VLBI Global Observing System (VGOS).
  Methods. We present VGOS observations of the blazar 1803+784 covering the 3-11 GHz frequency range. The data were processed using a dedicated calibration pipeline, followed by model fitting and multi-frequency imaging analysis. We measured the frequency-dependent core shift and mapped the spectral index and rotation measure (RM) across the source.
  Results. We find a core-shift power-law index of $k_r = 0.73^{+0.12}_{-0.19}$, significantly deviating from the expected equipartition value of $k_r = 1$. This indicates that either the equipartition condition or the conical jet geometry, or both, are not fulfilled in the centimetre-wavelength core region. The wide frequency coverage of VGOS also allows us to decouple the Faraday rotation of the core into an internal component (${\rm RM}_I = 121 \pm 8$ rad m$^{-2}$, produced in the core region) and an external component (${\rm RM}_E = -44 \pm 9$ rad m$^{-2}$, associated with a distant, extended medium that may also affect the polarization in downstream regions of the jet at larger scales).
  Conclusions. These results demonstrate the power of VGOS for high-fidelity simultaneous multi-frequency polarimetric studies of compact AGN jets, and underline the need to account for non-equipartition effects in both jet astrophysics and geodetic VLBI.
