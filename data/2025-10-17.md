### [1] [Dynamic SBI: Round-free Sequential Simulation-Based Inference with Adaptive Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13997)
*Huifang Lyu,James Alvey,Noemi Anau Montel,Mauro Pieroni,Christoph Weniger*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 提出了动态SBI方法，将顺序模拟推理的核心思想实现为无轮次、异步且高度并行的方式，显著降低了模拟成本和训练开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统顺序SBI方法在模拟和训练效率方面的局限性，特别是在高维物理应用中面临的数据量增长和模型复杂度增加的问题。

Method: 采用自适应数据集，在推理过程中迭代变换以匹配目标观测值。模拟和训练并行进行：训练好的网络用于过滤与数据不兼容的模拟，并提议新的更有前景的模拟。

Result: 动态SBI在保持推理性能的同时，显著提高了模拟和训练效率。在引力波背景分析和强引力透镜系统分析两个天体物理任务中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 动态SBI为顺序SBI提供了一个灵活高效的新范式，特别适合高维高精度推理场景。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is emerging as a new statistical paradigm
for addressing complex scientific inference problems. By leveraging the
representational power of deep neural networks, SBI can extract the most
informative simulation features for the parameters of interest. Sequential SBI
methods extend this approach by iteratively steering the simulation process
towards the most relevant regions of parameter space. This is typically
implemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network
training alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well
suited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are
commonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing
model fidelity. Here, we introduce dynamic SBI, which implements the core ideas
of sequential methods in a round-free, asynchronous, and highly parallelisable
manner. At its core is an adaptive dataset that is iteratively transformed
during inference to resemble the target observation. Simulation and training
proceed in parallel: trained networks are used both to filter out simulations
incompatible with the data and to propose new, more promising ones. Compared to
round-based sequential methods, this asynchronous structure can significantly
reduce simulation costs and training overhead. We demonstrate that dynamic SBI
achieves significant improvements in simulation and training efficiency while
maintaining inference performance. We further validate our framework on two
challenging astrophysical inference tasks: characterising the stochastic
gravitational wave background and analysing strong gravitational lensing
systems. Overall, this work presents a flexible and efficient new paradigm for
sequential SBI.

### [2] [Extracting latent representations from X-ray spectra. Classification, regression, and accretion signatures of Chandra sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14102)
*Nicolò Oreste Pinciroli Vago,Juan Rafael Martínez-Galarza,Roberta Amato*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 使用基于transformer的自编码器压缩钱德拉X射线光谱，通过8个潜在变量实现准确重建，并在潜在空间中实现约40%的分类准确率，表明该方法能有效提取物理相关信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钱德拉源目录（CSC）提供了丰富的X射线光谱数据，但这些数据在机器学习背景下尚未得到充分探索。本研究旨在开发一种紧凑且具有物理意义的钱德拉X射线光谱表示方法。

Method: 使用基于transformer的自编码器压缩X射线光谱，输入数据来自CSC的高显著性探测光谱，天体物理源类型和物理统计信息从外部目录获取。

Result: 自编码器用8个潜在变量准确重建光谱；在8个源类上的聚类平衡准确率约40%，仅限活动星系核和恒星质量致密天体时提高到约69%；潜在特征与光谱通量的非线性组合相关。

Conclusion: 提出的自编码器管道是表示和解释X射线光谱的强大工具，提供了支持分类和物理属性估计的紧凑潜在空间，展示了深度学习在光谱研究和发现X射线数据新模式方面的潜力。

Abstract: The study of X-ray spectra is crucial to understanding the physical nature of
astrophysical sources. Machine learning methods can extract compact and
informative representations of data from large datasets. The Chandra Source
Catalog (CSC) provides a rich archive of X-ray spectral data, which remains
largely underexplored in this context. This work aims to develop a compact and
physically meaningful representation of Chandra X-ray spectra using deep
learning. To verify that the learned representation captures relevant
information, we evaluate it through classification, regression, and
interpretability analyses. We use a transformer-based autoencoder to compress
X-ray spectra. The input spectra, drawn from the CSC, include only
high-significance detections. Astrophysical source types and physical summary
statistics are compiled from external catalogs. We evaluate the learned
representation in terms of spectral reconstruction accuracy, clustering
performance on 8 known astrophysical source classes, and correlation with
physical quantities such as hardness ratios and hydrogen column density
($N_H$). The autoencoder accurately reconstructs spectra with 8 latent
variables. Clustering in the latent space yields a balanced classification
accuracy of $\sim$40% across the 8 source classes, increasing to $\sim$69% when
restricted to AGNs and stellar-mass compact objects exclusively. Moreover,
latent features correlate with non-linear combinations of spectral fluxes,
suggesting that the compressed representation encodes physically relevant
information. The proposed autoencoder-based pipeline is a powerful tool for the
representation and interpretation of X-ray spectra, providing a compact latent
space that supports both classification and the estimation of physical
properties. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning for spectral
studies and uncovering new patterns in X-ray data.

### [3] [Polarisation Performance of Offset Phase Antennas: A Study for FARSIDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14178)

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 该论文分析了月球背面射电望远镜阵列中天线相位偏移对偏振响应和成像性能的影响，发现非共址天线会导致额外的斯托克斯U和V泄漏，影响系外行星电子回旋脉泽辐射的探测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 月球背面射电望远镜阵列（如FARSIDE）由遥控漫游车部署，可能导致正交偏振天线对之间的相位偏移，这种偏移会影响偏振测量精度，特别是对系外行星电子回旋脉泽辐射探测至关重要的斯托克斯V测量。

Method: 通过建模分析FARSIDE偶极子波束，比较共址和非共址情况下的性能差异；使用自定义仿真管道，结合所有四个斯托克斯波束，通过FARSIDE阵列对GLEAM天空模型生成可见度和模拟图像。

Result: 对于纯斯托克斯I输入天空，非共址情况下的输出图像最大斯托克斯V/I通量比增加到2.5%，而共址情况下仅为0.05%，表明相位偏移导致显著的偏振泄漏。

Conclusion: 天线相位偏移会显著影响射电望远镜阵列的偏振测量性能，产生额外的斯托克斯U和V泄漏，这对高保真斯托克斯V测量（如系外行星ECM辐射探测）至关重要，需要进行校正。

Abstract: Several radio telescopes have been planned or proposed to be deployed on the
Lunar farside in the coming years. These will observe the unexplored ultra-long
wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum from the lunar farside's unique
radio-quiet and ionosphere-free environment. One such lunar radio array is the
NASA-funded concept - the Farside Array for Radio Science Investigations of the
Dark Ages and Exoplanets (FARSIDE). FARSIDE will operate over 100~kHz to 40~MHz
with 128 spatially non-co-located orthogonal pairs of antenna nodes distributed
over a 12 X 12 km area in a four-arm spiral configuration. Being on the lunar
farside, this radio interferometer will be deployed by tele-operated rovers.
The rover deployment mode could lead to a phase offset between each of the two
orthogonally polarised antenna elements in the array, which are typically
co-located. In this paper, we quantify the effects of such antenna phase
offsets on the polarisation response and imaging performance of the lunar radio
array. Modelling and analysing the FARSIDE dipole beams with and without
offset, we find the latter leads to additional leakages into Stokes U and V
corresponding to Muller matrix terms of M2(0,1,2,3) and M3(0,1,2,3). Using a
custom simulation pipeline to incorporate all four Stokes beams of spatially
co-located and non-co-located dipoles, we produce visibilities and simulated
images for the GLEAM (GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA) sky model through
the FARSIDE array. We find that for a pure Stokes I input sky, the output image
maximum Stokes V/I flux ratio for the offset case has increased to 2.5% versus
0.05% for the co-located case. The additional Stokes V needs to be corrected
since the detection of Electron Cyclotron Maser (ECM) emissions from exoplanets
requires high-fidelity Stokes V measurements.

Abstract: Time domain surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory are projected to
annually discover millions of astronomical transients. This and complementary
programs demand fast, automated methods to constrain the physical properties of
the most interesting objects for spectroscopic follow up. Traditional
approaches to likelihood-based inference are computationally expensive and
ignore the multi-component energy sources powering astrophysical phenomena. In
this work, we present a hierarchical simulation-based inference model for
multi-band light curves that 1) identifies the energy sources powering an event
of interest, 2) infers the physical properties of each subclass, and 3)
separates physical anomalies in the learned embedding space. Our architecture
consists of a transformer-based light curve summarizer coupled to a
flow-matching regression module and a categorical classifier for the physical
components. We train and test our model on $\sim$150k synthetic light curves
generated with $\texttt{MOSFiT}$. Our network achieves a 90% classification
accuracy at identifying energy sources, yields well-calibrated posteriors for
all active components, and detects rare anomalies such as tidal disruption
events (TDEs) through the learned latent space. This work demonstrates a
scalable joint framework for population studies of known transients and the
discovery of novel populations in the era of Rubin.

Abstract: We present the methodology and results of the on-sky responsivity calibration

SPT-SLIM is a pathfinder line intensity mapping experiment utilizing the
on-chip spectrometer technology, and was first deployed during the 2024-2025
Austral Summer season on the South Pole Telescope. During the two-week on-sky
operation of SPT-SLIM, we performed periodic measurements of the detector
response as a function of the telescope elevation angle. Combining these data
with atmospheric opacity measurements from an on-site atmospheric tipping
radiometer, simulated South Pole atmospheric spectra, and measured detector
spectral responses, we construct estimates for the responsivity of SPT-SLIM
detectors to sky loading. We then use this model to calibrate observations of
the moon taken by SPT-SLIM, cross-checking the result against the known
brightness temperature of the Moon as a function of its phase.

Method: 在实验室中对Marana 4.2BV-11 CMOS相机进行详细表征，评估其在快速帧率（FFR）和高动态范围（HDR）两种模式下的性能参数。

Result: FFR模式读出噪声1.577e⁻，HDR模式1.571e⁻；FFR模式像素容量2366 e⁻/pix，HDR模式69026 e⁻/pix，动态范围93dB；线性度误差FFR 0.099%，HDR 0.122%；量子效率峰值>95% @ 560nm。

Abstract: Scientific CMOS cameras are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern
observational astronomy. We assess the ability of CMOS image sensors technology
to perform high-precision photometry with a detailed laboratory
characterization of the Marana 4.2BV-11 CMOS camera. We characterise the camera
in the Fastest Frame Rate (FFR) and High Dynamic Range (HDR) modes. Our
evaluation includes read noise, dark current, photo response and dark signal
non-uniformities, quantum efficiency and window transmittance. The read noise
is found to be 1.577\,e$^-$ for the FFR mode. For the HDR mode the read noise
floor is measured to be 1.571\,e$^-$ for signal levels below approximately
1800\,e$^-$. The bias level shows dark signal non-uniformities with values of
0.318\,e$^-$ and 0.232\,e$^-$ for FFR and HDR mode, respectively. Pixel well
capacity reached 2366 e$^-$pix$^{-1}$ for the FFR mode and 69026
e$^-$pix$^{-1}$ with a dynamic range of 93\,dB for the HDR mode. The camera
demonstrates good linearity, yielding linearity errors of 0.099\,\% for FFR
mode and 0.122\,\% for HDR mode. The uniformity across the image arrays show a
photo response non-uniformity of 0.294\,\% for the FFR mode and 0.131\,\% for
the HDR mode. The dark current displays a noticeable glow pattern, resulting in
mean dark current levels of $1.674\pm0.011$\, \eps\, for the FFR mode and
$1.617\pm0.008$\,\eps\, for the HDR mode at a constant temperature of
-25\,$^\circ$C. We measured the quantum efficiency across the visible spectrum,
with a peak of of >95\,\% at 560\,nm. Our tests indicate that the Marana CMOS
camera is potentially capable of performing precise photometry.

Motivation: 随着SETI研究方法的进步、国际参与度的扩大以及全球信息环境的日益复杂，原有的指导原则需要更新以保持相关性和有效性。

Method: 通过成立专门工作组，重新审视现有协议，考虑最新搜索方法、国际参与和全球信息环境变化，并通过结构化流程征求更广泛社区意见。

Conclusion: SETI协议具有活文件性质，需要持续改进以适应快速变化的世界，确保在探测到外星智能信号时能够提供有效指导。

Abstract: The International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) SETI Committee has long
provided guiding principles for responding to a potential detection of a SETI
signal. The foundational Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities
Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence, first formulated in
1989, has been widely recognised by the international scientific community. A
supplemental set of draft protocols addressing the possibility of a reply to an
extraterrestrial signal was prepared in 1995 by the IAA SETI Permanent
Committee, with both documents presented in a position paper to the UN
Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in 2000. In keeping with the
evolving landscape of SETI research, the IAA Declaration of Principles was
streamlined and updated in 2010. Recognising the need for continued adaptation,
the IAA SETI Committee established a Task Group in 2022 to re-examine the
protocols in light of recent advances in search methodologies, the expansion of
international participation in SETI, and the increasing complexity of the
global information environment. The Group recognises the living document nature
of the protocols, which will require ongoing refinement to remain relevant and
effective in a rapidly changing world. A draft revised Declaration of
Principles was presented at the IAC 2024 in Milan, and initial feedback was
received from the community, particularly members of the IAA SETI Committee.
Since then, we have continued to seek broader community input in a structured
process, refining the proposed updates based on further discussions and
consultations. A Revised Declaration of Principles, is presented here.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外时域巡天相对于光学巡天发展严重不足，需要利用南极Dome A的优越红外观测条件来研究动态红外天空。

Method: 开发了AIRBT系统，包含两个15厘米f/3望远镜和两个InGaAs相机，分别配备J和H滤光片。对InGaAs相机进行了性能表征，包括偏置、读出噪声、暗电流等参数分析，并在2022年10月进行了实地测试。

Conclusion: AIRBT成功填补了红外时域巡天的空白，证明了InGaAs相机在南极极端环境下的可行性，为动态红外天空研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Infrared time-domain surveys remain significantly underdeveloped compared
with their optical counterparts. We have developed the Antarctic Infrared
Binocular Telescope (AIRBT) to study the dynamic infrared sky at Dome A,
Antarctica, taking advantage of the superb infrared observational conditions at
this site. AIRBT consists of two identical 15 cm f/3 optical tube assemblies
and two cost-effective indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) cameras equipped with J
and H filters, respectively. The cameras have 640 x 512 pixels with a size of
15 micrometers, providing a scale of 6.9 arcseconds per pixel and a field of
view of 1.22 x 0.97 square degrees. We characterize the performance of the
InGaAs cameras, including bias, readout noise, dark current, nonlinearity, and
photon transfer curve. Our analysis highlights the distinct behaviors of InGaAs
cameras compared with charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The bias and readout noise
show temperature dependence, and the noise measured from the photon transfer
curves has additional components that increase with exposure time. On-sky tests
were conducted in October 2022 including system calibration, limiting depth,
and photometric precision. For a single 3-second exposure, we achieved 5-sigma
limiting magnitudes of 11.2 mag (Vega system) in J band and 9.7 mag in H band.
The best photometric precision reached 20 millimagnitudes at the bright end,
which could be further improved to sub-percent levels through image stacking.
AIRBT was installed at Dome A in January 2023, and scientific observations
began as soon as darkness set in.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明当宇宙线最大能量接近注入尺度时，非共振混合不稳定性能有效放大磁场，但随着最大能量增加，效率会下降，因为宇宙线电流由逃逸的高能宇宙线携带。

Method: 采用一维磁流体动力学-宇宙线框架，求解电报型扩散-对流方程，追踪宇宙线、磁场和激波动力学在真实参数下的耦合演化。

Result: 发现磁场强度存在明显转变：弱背景磁场下，非共振混合不稳定性有效放大上游湍流，驱动自调节状态；强背景磁场下，逃逸宇宙线电流太弱无法驱动不稳定性，磁湍流进一步衰减。

Conclusion: 给出了转变的物理解释，并讨论了在超高速外流反向激波中实现PeV-EeV能量加速的条件。

Abstract: We investigate magnetic-field amplification driven by the nonresonant hybrid
(NRH or Bell) instability and its impact on cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration at
reverse shocks of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei (AGN).
Previous kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that
when maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently
amplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of
NRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is
carried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional
MHD--CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion--convection equations to
trace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under
realistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field
strength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\!\lesssim\!10^{-4}\,\mathrm{G}$),
NRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a
self-regulated state where $E_{\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength
of magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields
($B_{0}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-3}\,\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to
drive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through
parametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We
give the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for
PeV--EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks.

Motivation: 研究辐射对超大质量黑洞双星环双星盘结构和观测特性的影响，为LISA引力波前兆和脉冲星计时阵列的电磁对应体探测提供理论依据。

Method: 使用全局三维辐射磁流体动力学模拟，模拟总质量2×10^7太阳质量、质量比0.1、分离距离100GM_tot/c^2的不等质量黑洞双星系统。

Result: 辐射使盘更薄、更密、内缘偏心率更低、更丝状；不等质量双星的热辐射比等质量双星亮几个数量级，在远紫外/软X射线波段变化更大；光变曲线主周期为2个双星轨道周期。

Conclusion: 辐射对超大质量黑洞双星环双星盘的结构和观测特性至关重要，不等质量双星系统可能更容易被电磁观测探测到。

Abstract: We present a global three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD)
simulation of a circumbinary disk (CBD) around a massive black hole binary
(MBHB) with a total mass $2 \times 10^7\,M_{\odot}$ and mass ratio $0.1$,
separated by $100\, GM_{\rm tot}/c^2$. The inclusion of radiation makes the
disk thinner, denser, less eccentric at the inner edge, and more filamentary
when compared to an otherwise identical locally isothermal MHD disk. The RMHD
disk has accretion rate $\sim 0.23\,\dot{M}_{\mathrm{Edd}}$ and produces
thermal emission peaking in the near-UV/optical with a luminosity of $\sim 1\,
\% L_{\rm {Edd }}$. Compared with an equal-mass binary with the same total
mass, the thermal emission of the CBD around the unequal-mass binary is several
orders of magnitude brighter and much more variable at far-UV/soft X-rays
frequencies. Similarly, we find that the light curve associated with the $0.1$
mass ratio binary exhibits dominant periodicity corresponding to 2 binary
orbits, compared to the equal-mass binary that shows periodicity at 2.5-5
binary orbits. Our results highlight the importance of radiation for the
structure and observational properties of MBHB circumbinary disks and have
implications for detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LISA gravitational
wave precursors and for the heavier binaries targeted by the Pulsar Timing
Arrays.

Abstract: Phenomenological studies of cosmic-ray self-confinement often hinge on the
linear theory for the growth rate of the streaming instability and for the
damping rate of the generated magnetic modes. Largely different expressions
exist, especially for the rate of nonlinear Landau damping, which is often
assumed to be the most important damping mechanism in warm ionized plasmas.
Using hybrid-PIC simulations in the resonant streaming instability regime, we
present a comprehensive assessment of nonlinear Landau damping and show that
the damping rate at a given scale depends on the power in magnetic fields on
larger scales. Furthermore, we find that an inverse cascade develops, which
produces magnetic fields on scales larger than the resonant ones. Here we
extend previous results obtained for a mono-energetic distribution of
non-thermal particles to the case of broader CR distributions, as a first step
towards developing phenomenological models. Pre-existing turbulence of
Alfv\'enic nature at large scales severely affects the damping of waves
produced by low-energy CRs; depending on its amplitude, such a turbulence may
inhibit the growth of streaming instability so that CRs are either
self-confined at all energies or not at all.

Abstract: Ultra-relativistic plasma outflows are intrinsically connected with gamma-ray
bursts. Over the years, a large number of analytical and numerical works has
been devoted to understanding the intricacies of their complex dynamics, with
most of these past studies performed in the ideal MHD regime. We propose a
self-similar formalism, based on the expansion of the equations of resistive
relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, for the description of these outflows in the
vicinity of their symmetry axis and present semi-analytical solutions
describing strongly relativistic jets in both the ideal and resistive MHD
regimes. Our solutions provide a clear picture of the impact of electromagnetic
dissipation on the acceleration and collimation mechanisms which determine the
kinetic and morphological characteristics of these relativistic outflows. The
resistive MHD solutions are compared to their ideal MHD counterparts, revealing
the key differences between the two regimes. Our comparative analysis sheds
light on the possible role of electromagnetic dissipation in shaping the
dynamics of the ultra-relativistic outflows associated with gamma-ray bursts.

Abstract: Two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) merger
remnant are a cheap alternative to 3D simulations. To maintain realism for
secular timescales, simulations must avoid accumulated errors from drifts in
conserved quantities and artificial heating, and they must model turbulent
transport in a way that remains plausible throughout the evolution. It is also
crucial to avoid numerical artifacts due to the polar coordinate axis
singularity. Methods that behave well near the axis often break
flux-conservative form of the hydrodynamic equations, resulting in significant
drifts in conserved quantities. We present a flux-conservative scheme that
maintains smoothness near the axis without sacrificing conservative formulation
of the equations or incurring drifts in conserved global quantities. We compare
the numerical performance of different treatments of the hydrodynamic equations
when evolving a hypermassive neutron star resembling the remnant of a BNS
merger. These simulations demonstrate that the new scheme combines the axis
smoothness of non-conservative methods with the mass and angular momentum
conservation of other conservative methods on $\sim$ $10^2$ ms timescales of
viscous and neutrino-driven evolution. Because fluid profiles remain smooth in
the remnant interior, it is possible to remove artificial heating by evolving
the entropy density. We show how physical heating and cooling terms can be
easily calculated from source terms of the conservative evolution variables and
demonstrate our implementation. Finally, we discuss and implement improvements
to the effective viscosity scheme to better model the effect of
magnetohydrodynamic instabilities as the remnant evolves.

TL;DR: IGR J17091-3624黑洞X射线双星候选体在2025年经历了一次"失败"爆发，NuSTAR观测首次探测到强吸收事件，揭示了日冕性质随光度演化以及稳定的准周期振荡特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究IGR J17091-3624作为除GRS 1915+105外唯一表现出广泛结构变异模式的黑洞候选体，特别是在"失败"爆发期间的物理过程。

Method: 使用NuSTAR望远镜进行6次定点观测，通过光谱和时序分析研究硬态光谱演化和吸收事件性质。

Result: 发现日冕性质随光度明显演化，前五个时期存在强且稳定的准周期振荡，第五时期探测到持续约4ks的强吸收事件，由电离物质部分遮挡引起。

Conclusion: 吸收事件与电离物质部分遮挡一致，为理解该系统轨道参数和距离提供了约束，揭示了硬态下稳定的盘反射特征。

Abstract: IGR J17091-3624 is the only black hole X-ray binary candidate, aside from the
well-studied black hole system GRS 1915+105, observed to exhibit a wide range
of structured variability patterns in its light curves. In 2025, the source
underwent a ``failed'' outburst: it brightened in the hard state but did not
transition to the soft state before returning to quiescence within a few weeks.
During this period, IGR J17091-3624 was observed by multiple ground- and
space-based facilities. Here, we present results from six pointed NuSTAR
observations obtained during the outburst. None of the NuSTAR light curves
showed the exotic variability classes typical of the soft state in this source;
however, we detected, for the first time, strong dips in the count rate during
one epoch, with a total duration of $\sim4\,\mathrm{ks}$ as seen by NuSTAR.
Through spectral and timing analysis of all six epochs, we investigate the
hard-state spectral evolution and the nature of the dips. A clear evolution of
the coronal properties with luminosity is observed over all six epochs, with
clear signatures of relativistic disk reflection which remain largely unchanged
across the first five epochs. The first five epochs also show a strong and
stable quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) feature in the power spectra. The dips
observed in Epoch 5 are consistent with partial obscuration by ionized material
with a column density $N_{\mathrm{H}} \approx 2.0 \times
10^{23}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. We discuss possible origins for this material and
place constraints on the orbital parameters and distance of the system.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: GW231123是迄今观测到的最重且自旋最高的双黑洞并合事件，其超大质量和极端自旋难以用标准双星物理解释，可能是通过致密星团中的分层合并形成的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GW231123的极大质量和极端自旋挑战了标准双星演化理论，需要探索非传统形成机制来解释这一特殊事件。

Method: 研究通过分析GW231123的自旋参数，评估其在致密星团中通过分层合并（即两个第二代黑洞的合并）形成的可能性。

Result: 研究发现，虽然可能但概率很低（p≲1%），GW231123的两个组分黑洞都具备如此高自旋的情况可以通过星团中的分层合并形成。

Conclusion: GW231123可能源于致密星团中的分层合并过程，但这种两个组分都具极高自旋的情况形成概率极低，表明其形成机制可能更为复杂。

Abstract: The binary black hole merger GW231123 is both the most massive
gravitational-wave event observed and has the highest component spins measured
to date. The dimensionless spins of the more massive (primary) and less massive
(secondary) black holes are measured to be $\chi_1 = 0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and
$\chi_2 = 0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$ ($90\%$ credible intervals), respectively. Its
large mass and extremal spins are challenging to explain through standard
binary stellar physics, though a flurry of hypothetical scenarios have been
proposed. Hierarchical assembly -- i.e., mergers of black holes that are
themselves formed from previous generations of mergers -- is generally a
promising way to explain massive and rapidly spinning black holes. Here, we
investigate the possibility that both GW231123 was assembled hierarchically in
a dense star cluster as the merger of two second-generation black holes. Taking
the inferred spin values at face value, we find that it is possible, though
unlikely ($p\lesssim 1\%$), that a compact binary with both component spins
like GW231123 could form in a cluster from hierarchical assembly.

Conclusion: 成功应用新方法获得了最大的软X射线波段弯曲样本，更新了X射线变异性平面，弯曲时间尺度范围从7分钟到62天。

Abstract: Accreting supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies are the engine
of active galactic nuclei (AGN). X-ray light curves of unabsorbed AGN show
dramatic random variability on timescales ranging from seconds to years. The
power spectrum of the fluctuations is usually well-modelled with a power law
that decays as $1/f$ at low frequencies, and which bends to $1/f^{2-3}$ at high
frequencies. The timescale associated with the bend correlates well with the
mass of the black hole and may also correlate with bolometric luminosity in the
`X-ray variability plane'. Because AGN light curves are usually irregularly
sampled, the estimation of AGN power spectra is challenging. In a previous
paper, we introduced a new method to estimate the parameters of bending power
law power spectra from AGN light curves. We apply this method to a sample of 56
variable and unabsorbed AGN, observed with XMM-Newton and Swift in the
$0.3-1.5$ keV band over the past two decades. We obtain estimates of the bends
in 50 sources, which is the largest sample of X-ray bends in the soft band. We
also find that the high-frequency power spectrum is often steeper than 2. We
update the X-ray variability plane with new bend timescale measurements
spanning from 7 min to 62 days. We report the detections of low-frequency bends
in the power spectra of five AGN, three of which are previously unpublished: 1H
1934-063, Mkn 766 and Mkn 279.

TL;DR: 本文重新评估了电子俘获衰变对银河宇宙射线的影响，发现在当前数据中EC衰变的影响可以忽略，但未来针对Z>30宇宙射线的项目可能需要进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子俘获不稳定物种在银河宇宙射线中可用于约束核合成与加速之间的时间间隔，也可作为传输过程中再加速或气体不均匀性的示踪剂。随着质量增加，EC不稳定物种数量增多，其影响对更大原子数和更低能量更为重要。

Method: 在扩散和漏盒模型中求解多电子配置（最多可附着任意数量电子）的传输方程。检验标准的两级近似（宇宙射线核完全电离或带一个电子）是否足够。

Result: 发现EC衰变的影响在当前数据中可以忽略，除非涉及$^{51}$Cr、$^{55}$Fe和Co的通量或比值。这些结论对附着和剥离截面的显著不确定性具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 标准的两级近似对于大多数情况已经足够。EC衰变在当前数据中的影响可以忽略，但未来针对Z>30宇宙射线的项目需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Electron-capture (EC) unstable species in Galactic cosmic rays constrain the
time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and acceleration. They have also been
advocated as tracers of reacceleration or gas inhomogeneities during their
transport. The number of EC-unstable species grows with mass, with an expected
EC-decay impact more important for larger atomic number and lower energy. We
revisit the modelling of EC decay and its detectability in the context of
recent unmodulated low-energy (Voyager) and high-precision data for heavy
(AMS-02) and very-heavy nuclei (ACE-CRIS, CALET and Super-TIGER). We solve the
transport equation for a multi-level configuration (up to any number of
electrons attached) in the diffusion and leaky-box models. Their decayed
fractions are found to be qualitatively similar but with very different
absolute fluxes. We check that the standard two-level approximation, wherein
the cosmic-ray nucleus is fully ionised or with one electron attached, is
sufficient for most situations. We find that the impact of EC-decay is
negligible in current data, except possibly for fluxes or ratios involving
$^{51}$Cr, $^{55}$Fe, and Co. These conclusions are robust against significant
uncertainties in the attachment and stripping cross-sections. This first
analysis calls for further investigation, as several forthcoming projects
(e.g., TIGERISS) are targeting $Z>30$ cosmic rays.

radio antennas, and a central DAQ. The final upgrade of the scintillation
detectors and their firmware at the prototype station has extended the dynamic
range and increased the data-taking up-time, thereby expanding the observation
window for air showers. This contribution will discuss the performance of the
upgraded prototype station after commissioning and its angular resolution
capabilities when observing air showers with the scintillation detectors and in
coincidence with IceTop. Furthermore, the integration of additional stations
during the most recent deployment will be discussed.

Abstract: Recent long-term radio monitoring of tidal disruption events (TDEs) suggests
that radio afterglows are common. Most studies argue that these afterglows may
arise from forward shocks (FS) produced by the interaction between the TDE
outflow and the hot, diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM). Current theoretical
models do not model the evolution of relativistic electrons in space, which
introduces uncertainties. Here we conducted hydrodynamic simulations to study
the hydrodynamic evolution of relativistic electrons, and calculated the
synchrotron spectra via radiative transfer. We focus on the FS scenario with
non-relativistic outflows, and various parameters of the outflow and CNM are
explored. A moderate outflow with kinetic energy of several $10^{50}$ erg in a
Galactic center - like CNM can produce mJy-level radio afterglows at a distance
of 100 Mpc. The self-absorption frequency exhibits a slow decline at early
times and a rapid decrease at late times. We derived the temporal evolution of
the high-frequency radio flux, revealing its characteristic rise and decline
pattern. We also find that: (1) the radio spectra for narrow outflows are
clearly anisotropic along different sight lines; (2) the FS parameters inferred
from radio spectra using conventional analytical formulas deviate significantly
from those in simulations, in which the inferred shock radii are half of those
from simulations, and the inferred energies are an order of magnitude lower.

TL;DR: 研究发现星系团中心活动星系核注入的GeV宇宙射线通过逆康普顿散射宇宙微波背景光子，会产生显著的X射线信号，可能被误认为是星系团内介质的热韧致辐射连续谱，这有助于解释冷却流问题。

Motivation: 探索冷却流问题——X射线推断的星系团内介质冷却速率与缺乏恒星形成之间的矛盾，研究宇宙射线逆康普顿散射是否会产生被误认为热韧致辐射的X射线信号。

Method: 使用ZwCl 3146星系团，比较X射线和热Sunyaev-Zel'dovich效应推导的压力分布，分析X射线光谱拟合两成分模型（热星系团内介质和宇宙射线逆康普顿发射）。

Result: 在ZwCl 3146中心100 kpc范围内测量到P_SZ/P_X约30%的减少，统计显著性约3.3σ，与宇宙射线逆康普顿污染预测一致。光谱拟合支持宇宙射线逆康普顿是造成这种减少的原因。

Conclusion: 研究证实宇宙射线逆康普顿发射在ZwCl 3146中可能是显著的，但需要更大样本的详细研究来评估其对冷却流问题的相关性。

Abstract: We explore the possibility that inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of cosmic
microwave background photons by $\sim$GeV cosmic rays (CRs) injected by the
central active galactic nucleus (AGN) in cool core (CC) clusters produces a
non-negligible continuum-like X-ray signal that is easily misinterpreted as
intracluster medium (ICM) thermal bremsstrahlung continuum. This is
particularly relevant to the cooling flow problem--the lack of star formation
relative to X-ray-inferred ICM cooling rates. Using ZwCl 3146, a relaxed CC
system at $z = 0.291$, we compare pressure profiles derived via X-rays and the
thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. While SZ measurements probe only
thermal ICM electrons, additional CR-IC emission would appear to boost the
X-ray-inferred pressure. Relative to unity, we measure a $\simeq30\%$ decrement
in $P_{SZ}/P_X$ within 100 kpc of the ZwCl 3146 center at a statistical
significance of $\simeq 3.3\sigma$, consistent with predicted deficits from
CR-IC contamination in reasonable models of central AGN-driven CR injection.
X-ray spectral fits of a two-component model with thermal ICM and CR-IC
emission are consistent with CR-IC as the cause of this deficit. We test
alternative explanations and systematics that could drive such a decrement,
with the leading order systematics associated with halo triaxiality.
Collectively, these systematics are unlikely to produce a $P_{SZ}/P_X$
decrement $\gtrsim10\%$. While our results establish that non-negligible CR-IC
emission is plausible in ZwCl 3146, we stress that more detailed studies of
larger cluster samples are required to robustly assess whether CR-IC is
relevant to the cooling flow problem.

Abstract: The rich phenomenology of binary neutron star mergers offers a unique
opportunity to test general relativity, investigate matter at supranuclear
densities, and learn more about the origin of heavy elements. As
multi-messenger sources, they emit both gravitational waves and electromagnetic
radiation across several frequency bands. The interpretation of these signals
relies heavily on accurate numerical-relativity simulations that incorporate
the relevant microphysical processes. Using the latest updates of the BAM code,
we perform general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
binary neutron star mergers with two different spin configurations. We adopt a
state-of-the-art equation of state based on relativistic mean-field theory
developed for dense matter in neutron star mergers. To capture both dynamical
ejecta and secular outflows from magnetic and neutrino-driven winds, we evolve
the systems up to $\sim 100\ \rm ms$ after the merger at considerably high
resolution with a grid spacing of $\Delta x \approx 93\ \rm m$ across the
neutron stars. Our results show that the non-spinning configuration undergoes a
more violent merger, producing more ejecta with lower electron fraction and
higher velocities, while the spinning configuration forms a larger disk due to
its higher angular momentum. Although the initial magnetic field amplification
within $\lesssim 10\ \rm ms$ after merger is similar in both systems, the
non-spinning system reaches stronger magnetic fields and higher energies at
later times. For a detailed view of the multi-messenger observables, we extract
the gravitational-wave signal and compute nucleosynthesis yields, the expected
kilonova and afterglow light curves from our ejecta profiles.

Motivation: GRB 230307A是极亮的长时间伽马射线暴，但其前身星来源不确定，存在多种可能的天体物理情景需要研究。

Method: 使用贝叶斯多波段光变曲线分析，评估四种可能的前身星模型和三种不同的中心引擎模型，通过贝叶斯因子和留一交叉验证来评估模型性能。

Result: 统计分析显示，最可能的前身星是中子星双星或中子星-白矮星系统，产生由磁星和⁵⁶Ni衰变驱动的千新星，⁵⁶Ni质量约为4×10⁻⁴M⊙，抛射物质量为0.06M⊙。

Abstract: GRB 230307A is one of the brightest long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
ever detected, yet its progenitor remains uncertain due to the variety of
plausible astrophysical scenarios. In this work, we investigate four possible
progenitors for GRB 230307A: a binary neutron star (BNS), a neutron star--white
dwarf (NS--WD) system, a neutron star--black hole (NS--BH) merger, and a tidal
disruption event (TDE) involving a white dwarf and a supermassive black hole.
Additionally, we explore three distinct central engine models powering the
kilonova associated with the BNS: radioactive decay of $r$-process nuclei in a
two-component ejecta model, a magnetar-driven model including magnetic dipole
spin-down, and a combined model of magnetar spin-down with ${}^{56}$Ni
radioactive decay. We perform Bayesian multi-wavelength light-curve analyses
using physically motivated models and priors, and evaluate model performance
through Bayes factors and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) scores. Our
results show a statistical preference for a BNS or NS--WD progenitor producing
a kilonova powered by a magnetar and ${}^{56}$Ni decay, characterized by a
${}^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim4\times10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ and an ejecta mass of
$0.06\,M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, under the assumption of a BNS origin within
this model, we infer binary component masses of $m_{1} =
1.81^{+0.46}_{-0.61}\,M_{\odot}$ and $m_{2} = 1.61^{+0.65}_{-0.41}\,M_{\odot}$,
with a dimensionless tidal deformability of $\tilde{\Lambda} =
471^{+318}_{-395}$. From the component mass posteriors, we infer that the
observed offset can be explained by a natal kick as long as the systemic
velocity is nearly aligned with the pre-kick orbital motion. In this case, the
required kick velocity (co-moving frame) and binary separation range within
$v'_{\mathrm{k}}\sim100$--$150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, and
$a_0\sim2$--$3~R_{\odot}$, respectively.

TL;DR: MHD模拟首次显示，费米气泡状的双瓣伽马射线外流可由恒星形成和超新星反馈形成，无需活动星系核参与。这些外流在所有三个模拟的银河系质量星系中都存在，其伽马射线光谱的振幅、形状和组成随时间波动。

Motivation: 研究费米气泡状伽马射线外流的形成机制，探索是否可以不依赖活动星系核，仅通过恒星形成和超新星反馈产生类似结构。

Method: 使用具有宇宙学初始条件的MHD模拟，结合动态、实时多物种宇宙射线传输模型，模拟MeV-TeV能量区间内的伽马射线发射，包括中性π介子衰变、相对论性非热韧致辐射和逆康普顿散射。

Result: 在所有三个银河系质量模拟星系中都发现了伽马射线外流，其光谱特征随时间波动，存在轻子主导和强子主导阶段。逆康普顿散射产生的伽马射线通量比中性π介子衰变高约1个数量级时，与费米-LAT测量的光谱吻合良好。

Conclusion: 恒星形成和超新星反馈足以产生费米气泡状伽马射线外流，无需活动星系核参与。这些模拟还预测了软X射线和同步辐射射电的多波长特征，为连接银河系周围介质与宇宙射线物理提供了新的观测特征。

Abstract: For the first time, we show in MHD simulations with cosmological initial
conditions that bi-lobed gamma-ray outflows similar to the Fermi bubbles can
form from star formation and supernova feedback, without involvement from
active galactic nuclei (AGN). We use simulations run with full MHD and
dynamical, on-the-fly multi-species cosmic ray transport in MeV-TeV energy bins
to model gamma-ray emission in Milky Way-mass spiral galaxies from neutral pion
decay, relativistic non-thermal Bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton scattering.
We find that these gamma-ray outflows are present in all three Milky-Way mass
simulated galaxies. The amplitude, shape, and the composition of the gamma-ray
spectrum of these bubbles fluctuates over time, with lepton-dominated and
hadron-dominated phases. Spectra in which there is O(1) more gamma-ray flux
from inverse Compton scattering than neutral pion decay are a good fit to the
measured Fermi-LAT spectrum. Additionally, these simulations predict
multi-wavelength features in soft x-rays and synchrotron radio, potentially
providing new observational signatures that can connect the circumgalactic
medium to cosmic ray physics and activity in the galactic center.

Abstract: Galactic microquasar SS433 and the radio nebula W50 surrounding it present a
prototypical example of a hyper-Eddington binary system shaping its ambient
interstellar medium via energetic outflows. In this paper, we present X-ray
observations of the SS433/W50 complex by the eROSITA telescope onboard the SRG
space observatory. These data provide images of the entire nebula characterized
by a very large dynamic range and allow spectral analysis of the diffuse X-ray
emission. In particular, these data illustrate a close connection between the
thermal and non-thermal components of W50 on scales ranging from sub-parsecs,
represented by narrow X-ray bright filaments, to the entire extent $\gtrsim
100\,{\rm pc}$ of the nebula. These data also allow us to fully characterize a
pair of nearly symmetric, sharp-edged, elongated structures aligned with the
orbital axis of the binary system, which lack radio counterparts, but are
prominent in very high energy gamma-ray emission. The resulting multifaceted
picture of the interaction between energetic outflows and the surrounding
medium paves the way for future focused multiwavelength observations and
dedicated numerical simulations.
