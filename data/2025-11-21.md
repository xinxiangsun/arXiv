  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究宇宙铁核在超高能宇宙射线中的传播特性，以了解宇宙射线的起源和传播机制

Method: 假设超高能宇宙射线起源于银河系外，分析铁核在传播过程中与背景辐射的相互作用和碎裂过程

Result: 发现铁核的能量可以用来限制其源的距离

Conclusion: 铁核的能量可以作为确定宇宙射线源距离的重要指标

Abstract: The propagation of cosmic iron nuclei with energies above 10^19 eV from their sources to the Galaxy is discussed by assuming that cosmic rays at ultra-high energies are of extragalactic origin. In extragalactic space, cosmic nuclei interact with background emissions and inevitably fragment. An analysis is performed of the fraction of iron nuclei reaching the Earth and how its energy depends on the distance from cosmic ray sources. It is found that energies of iron nuclei can be used to determine restriction on the distances from their sources

### [2] [How Bright in Gravitational Waves are Millisecond Pulsars for the Galactic Center GeV Gamma-Ray Excess? A Systematic Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15793)
*Ming-Yu Lei,Bei Zhou,Xiaoyuan Huang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 利用引力波探测银河系中心毫秒脉冲星群，以检验其对银河系中心GeV伽马射线超量的解释，为暗物质研究提供新途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 银河系中心GeV伽马射线超量(GCE)可能是暗物质湮灭信号，也可能是毫秒脉冲星(MSP)群产生的。由于电磁波段探测困难，需要引力波这一互补探测手段来验证MSP解释。

Method: 系统研究解释GCE的MSP群的引力波辐射及其可探测性，考虑三种椭圆度起源模型，包括孤立MSP和双星系统中的MSP，以及探测中的多普勒效应。

Result: 当前干涉仪无法探测到该信号，但下一代探测器如爱因斯坦望远镜(ET)和宇宙探索者(CE)能够探测到部分MSP。

Conclusion: 未来对银河系中心的定向搜索将揭示这一长期寻找的MSP群，或对其椭圆度和丰度设置严格限制，对GCE的天体物理和暗物理解释都具有重要意义。

Abstract: The existence of dark matter (DM) is supported by various macroscopic observations, but its microscopic nature remains elusive. The Galactic Center GeV gamma-ray excess (GCE) has been a leading candidate signal for particle dark matter annihilation. However, an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the bulge provides the alternative explanation for the excess. Identifying these MSPs in electromagnetic bands is difficult due to source confusion, pulse broadening, and extinction. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a complementary probe: a steadily rotating, non-axisymmetric MSP emits a nearly monochromatic GW signal in the sensitive band of ground-based detectors, with amplitude set by its ellipticity. In this work, we systematically investigate the GW emission from the MSP population proposed to explain the GCE and its detectability with current and future detectors. We consider three major scenarios for the origin of ellipticity and model the population properties of these MSPs. We also consider both isolated MSPs and MSPs in binary systems, as well as Doppler effects in the detection. We find that while the signal is below the reach of current interferometers, next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) can detect a fraction of those MSPs, offering a novel test of the MSP interpretation of the GCE. Future directed searches toward the Galactic Center with continued improvements in sensitivities will either uncover this long-sought MSP population or place stringent limits on their ellipticities and abundance, with important implications for both the astrophysical and dark-matter interpretations of the GCE.

TL;DR: SN 2019vxm是首个在TESS数据中捕捉到上升阶段的IIn型超亮超新星，其早期光变曲线呈现n=1.41的浅幂律上升，与X射线暂现源GRB191117A存在时空关联，支持致密不对称星周介质中的激波突破模型。

Motivation: 研究IIn型超新星早期阶段的激波突破和喷流驱动高能辐射特征，特别关注致密星周环境中的早期物理过程。

Method: 利用TESS高时间分辨率测光数据捕捉超新星上升阶段，结合X射线观测进行时空关联分析，采用断裂幂律模型拟合早期光变曲线。

Result: 成功约束了SN 2019vxm的首光时间在7.2小时内，发现与GRB191117A存在3.3σ置信度的时空关联，光变曲线指数n=1.41显著浅于标准n=2模型。

Conclusion: 观测结果支持激波突破进入致密不对称星周介质的模型，表明前身星可能是从明亮蓝变星向沃尔夫-拉叶星过渡的大质量致密恒星。

Abstract: Shock breakout and, in some cases, jet-driven high-energy emission are increasingly recognized as key signatures of the earliest phases of core-collapse supernovae, especially in Type IIn systems due to their dense, interaction-dominated circumstellar environments. We present a comprehensive photometric analysis of SN 2019vxm, a long-duration, luminous Type IIn supernova, $M_V^{}=-21.41\pm0.05\;{\rm mag}$, observed from X-ray to near-infrared. SN 2019vxm is the first superluminous supernovae Type IIn to be caught with well-sampled TESS photometric data on the rise and has a convincing coincident X-ray source at the time of first light. The high-cadence TESS light curve captures the early-time rise, which is well described by a broken power law with an index of $n=1.41\pm0.04$, significantly shallower than the canonical $n=2$ behavior. From this, we constrain the time of first light to within 7.2 hours. We identify a spatial and temporal coincidence between SN 2019vxm and the X-ray transient GRB191117A, corresponding to a $3.3σ$ association confidence. Both the short-duration X-ray event and the lightcurve modeling are consistent with shock breakout into a dense, asymmetric circumstellar medium, indicative of a massive, compact progenitor such as a luminous blue variable transitioning to Wolf-Rayet phase embedded in a clumpy, asymmetric environment.

TL;DR: 对SDSS类星体中具有多个Gaia探测的候选系统进行VLBI高分辨率成像研究，通过结合Gaia和VLBI的精确天体测量，澄清这些系统的真实性质并改进双活动星系核候选样本的筛选。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究发现一类SDSS类星体具有多个Gaia探测，可能是类星体-恒星对、双类星体或引力透镜类星体等天体物理系统。需要高分辨率观测来精确分类这些多重匹配源。

Method: 将SQUAB类星体样本与FIRST和NVSS射电星表交叉匹配，选出18个射电源，选择最亮的3个进行双频(1.6和4.9 GHz)VLBA观测，在Gaia两个位置进行VLBI成像，构建谱指数图并估算亮度温度。

Result: 对三个目标源的VLBI观测显示，在主要Gaia位置发现与单个活动星系核一致的致密射电结构，在次要Gaia位置未检测到显著辐射。

Conclusion: 这些结果支持源为类星体-恒星对的解释，证实了Gaia-VLBI组合方法在解析模糊类星体系统方面的价值，能够明确揭示系统真实性质并帮助从双活动星系核候选样本中去除污染源。

Abstract: Our previous work identified a class of SDSS quasars exhibiting multiple Gaia detections, classifying them as candidates for various astrophysical systems such as quasar-star pairs, dual quasars, and gravitationally lensed quasars. In this paper, we present a pilot VLBI study targeting a radio-bright subsample and report the first high-resolution imaging results. By leveraging the milliarcsecond-scale resolution of VLBI and its precise astrometric coordination incorporating with Gaia, we aim to refine the classification of these multiple matched sources, search for potential dual AGNs, and assess the efficacy of the combined Gaia-VLBI approach in resolving ambiguous quasar systems. We cross-matched the SQUAB quasar sample with the FIRST and NVSS catalogs, identifying 18 radio-emitting sources. The three brightest were selected for dual-frequency (1.6 and 4.9 GHz) VLBA observations. We performed VLBI imaging at both Gaia positions, constructed spectral index maps, and estimated brightness temperatures to characterize the radio morphology and physical properties. For the three target sources, our VLBI observations reveal compact radio structures consistent with single AGN at the primary Gaia positions. No significant emission is detected at the secondary Gaia locations. These results support the interpretation of the sources as quasar$-$star pairs, in line with earlier studies. This pilot study demonstrates the value of radio-VLBI high-resolution follow-ups on Gaia-selected quasar systems with multiple counterparts, showing how they can unambiguously reveal the true nature of these systems and help remove contaminants from dual AGN candidate samples.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 通过重新分析Cygnus X-1在2022年低硬态的数据，发现双康普顿化成分模型比单成分模型更符合观测。降低盘温度可增加偏振度，但模拟值仍低于观测值。研究支持硬成分位于三明治式平板几何结构的观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释IXPE观测到的高偏振度（约4%）与理论预期（约1%）的差异，探索Cygnus X-1盘/冕系统的几何结构。

Method: 使用IXPE、NuSTAR和NICER数据进行联合分析，采用双康普顿化成分模型，研究谱的时间变异性，并进行详细模拟比较不同冕几何结构。

Result: 发现双康普顿化模型优于单成分模型，盘光子温度约0.15 keV。降低盘温度可增加偏振度约2个百分点，但模拟偏振度仍显著低于观测值。平板冕几何预测的偏振特性与观测一致。

Conclusion: Cygnus X-1在2022年5月表现出具有不同光学深度的双康普顿化冕辐射，硬成分位于三明治式平板几何结构中。偏振度受黑洞和冕的其他参数影响。

Abstract: Cygnus X-1 (Cyg X-1) exhibited a low hard state in 2022, observed by several missions. The IXPE reported that the polarization angle is aligned with the radio jet and gave a polarization degree approximately 4 times higher than the general expectations of $1\%$ through the analysis of the time-integrated data with a simple spectral model, indicating that the disk inclination is higher than a canonical value of about $30^{\circ}$. Many subsequent theoretical studies employed a non-standard model to explain this high PD. Here, we revisit the disk/corona spectrum through a detailed joint analysis using IXPE, NuSTAR, and NICER data. By investigating the time variability of the spectrum, we find that the two-Comptonization components model can better reproduce the data than the one-Comptonization component model originally adopted. We observed a lower disk photon temperature of about 0.15 keV. Detailed simulation suggests that lowering the disk temperature by a factor of 2 increases the PD by roughly 2 percentage points in the IXPE 2--8 keV band for a slab-like corona geometry, helping to reconcile the observed high PD with theoretical predictions. However, The simulated PDs are still significantly lower than the observed ones - even for a rather high $60^{\circ}$ inclination. We also investigated the polarization properties of a simple wedge-shaped corona with a truncated disk and a sandwiching slab corona. We find that the slab corona predicts an apparent energy dependence in PD while PA remains constant in the IXPE band, in agreement with the observed polarization. Therefore, we suggest that Cyg X-1 in 2022 May exhibits a two-Comptonization coronal emission with different optical depths, and the hard one is in a sandwiching slab geometry. We also discuss how the polarization is affected by other parameters of the black hole and the corona.

Abstract: Analogous to the HR diagram for stars, the thermal equilibrium curve encodes the thermodynamics of accretion disks by expressing the local balance between heating -- primarily via viscous dissipation -- and cooling -- typically through radiative transfer. These curves are commonly plotted as surface density versus effective temperature. When an S-shaped locus appears, local annuli become bistable, and limit-cycle oscillations arise when the external mass-transfer rate falls within an unstable band. This behavior underpins the disk instability model for recurring outbursts in cataclysmic variables. This paper reviews first-principles thermal equilibrium curves for accretion disks driven by magnetorotational instability (MRI), with emphasis on dwarf novae. Unlike the parameterized $α$-viscosity approach, the curves are obtained by solving the governing equations with radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations, thereby reproducing S-shaped loci without prescribing $α$. The disk instability in dwarf-nova systems and the physical origin of angular-momentum transport (shear stresses) are also briefly reviewed. Notes on the stability of radiation-dominated accretion flows are included in the Appendix.

TL;DR: 爱因斯坦探针首次捕捉到Aql X-1低质量X射线双星爆发的早期上升阶段，发现X射线发射最多比光学上升延迟3天，并在爆发两周后经历了约12小时的快速硬态到软态转变。

Conclusion: 这些结果为理解吸积中子星和黑洞中爆发演化和状态转变的时间尺度提供了重要线索。

Abstract: Transient Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are usually first detected by all-sky X-ray monitors when they enter new outbursts, typically at X-ray luminosities above $\sim$10$^{36}$ erg/s. Observations of these sources during the early rise of the outbursts have so far been very limited. However, the launch of the Einstein Probe (EP) has greatly improved our ability to detect fainter X-ray activity, unlocking access to the outburst early rise. In September 2024, EP detected the early onset of a new outburst from the neutron star LMXB Aql X-1, catching the source at a luminosity below 10$^{35}$ erg/s. In this paper we present results from a comprehensive, multi-wavelength campaign of this event, combining data from EP, NICER, NuSTAR, Swift and Las Cumbres Observatory covering the full outburst from its early rise through its decay. By comparing X-ray and optical light curves obtained with Las Cumbres Observatory during the initial rise, we show that the start of the X-ray emission lagged the optical rise by, at most, 3 days. Time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy revealed how the geometry and the physical properties of the accretion flow evolve during this early stage of the outburst, as well as at higher luminosities as the source transitioned through the canonical X-ray spectral states - hard, intermediate and soft. These data show that the source underwent a very rapid, about 12-h long, transition from the hard to the soft state about two weeks after the optical onset of the outburst. The evolution of the temperature and physical sizes of both the inner region of the disk and a black body near the NS surface suggest that at the state transition, a boundary and spreading layer likely formed. We discuss these results in the context of time-scales for outburst evolution and state transitions in accreting neutron stars and black holes.

Abstract: Observed metal abundances in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy groups and clusters, $Z_{ICM}$, exceed what is expected from present-day stellar populations alone. Galaxy clusters are presumed to be near closed-box systems, allowing constraints to be placed on the origins of metals and stellar populations responsible for $Z_{ICM}$. We present a uniform XMM-Newton survey of 26 galaxy groups and clusters, measuring radial metallicity profiles and relating $Z_{ICM}$ with the stellar fraction $M_*/M_{gas}$. We determine $Z_{ICM}$ via spectral fitting across multiple annuli finding a best fit of $Z_{ICM} = -0.08^{+0.07}_{-0.07}\, log\left(\frac{M_*}{M_{gas}}\right) + 0.30^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ with intrinsic scatter $σ_p = 0.09^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$. We use closed-box chemical evolution models to estimate the metallicity yield from observable stellar populations, incorporating updated supernova yields and corrections for metals locked in remnants, $Z_* = (1.14 \pm 0.52) \, log\left(1 + \frac{M_*}{M_{gas}}\right)$. Our results demonstrate that present-day stellar populations systematically underpredict $Z_{ICM}$, with an inferred excess component increasing in systems with low $M_*/M_{gas}$. This trend supports the need for an early enrichment population (EEP) distinct from visible stars, $Z_{EEP}$. We find this necessity holds when reconsidering the closed-box assumption by removing all galaxy groups, potential leaky systems, deriving $Z_{EEP}$ within $1σ$ when including and excluding groups. Three systems (NGC1132, NGC5098, and NGC4325) deviate from the survey trend, exhibiting steep negative radial metallicity gradients and unusually low $Z_{ICM}$. We posit these systems to be late-forming whose ICM enrichment reflects only recent stellar populations. Our analysis quantifies the necessity of an EEP and provides trends for testing cluster chemical evolution models.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的张量网络框架，用于模拟中微子在致密天体环境中的非均匀和各向异性风味演化，解决了现有多体研究受限于小系统规模、封闭边界和理想化对称假设的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 致密天体环境中的中微子风味演化本质上是非线性的，对超越平均场近似的多体量子效应敏感。现有研究受限于小系统规模、封闭边界和高度理想化的对称假设，需要开发能够模拟真实天体物理条件的框架。

Method: 开发了一个统一的张量网络框架，能够模拟非均匀和各向异性的中微子风味演化，适用于核心坍缩超新星和中子星合并的条件。该框架允许直接比较不同设置下的结果。

Result: 多体系统比平均场对应物更早达到平衡，但趋向相似的风味终态。扩大相互作用区域可使开放边界重现封闭系统行为，但仅限于光束初始叠加且持续相互作用的情况。初始分离的配置纠缠发展较慢，相互作用时间更长，平衡后的风味含量与初始叠加计算不同。

Conclusion: 张量网络框架为研究致密天体环境中的中微子风味演化提供了强大工具，揭示了初始条件和边界效应对多体量子动力学的显著影响，强调了在真实天体物理模拟中考虑这些因素的重要性。

Abstract: Neutrino flavor evolution in dense astrophysical environments is inherently nonlinear and sensitive to many-body (MB) quantum effects beyond the mean-field (MF) approximation. Existing MB studies are constrained by small system sizes, closed boundaries, and highly idealized symmetry assumptions. We present a unified tensor-network framework that enables simulations of inhomogeneous and anisotropic flavor evolution under conditions relevant to core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers. Within this framework, we examine the effects of inhomogeneity, boundary conditions, and convergence with resolution for multiple neutrino distributions, allowing direct comparison of these setups under one consistent formulation. In our simulations, many-body systems equilibrate earlier than their mean-field counterparts while approaching similar final flavor states. Enlarging the interaction region allows open boundaries to reproduce closed-system behavior, but only when the beams begin superimposed and interact continuously. By contrast, initially separated configurations develop entanglement more slowly, interact over longer times, and equilibrate to a flavor content that differs from that obtained from initially superimposed calculations.

TL;DR: 中子星热演化研究：结合旋转化学加热和涡旋蠕变机制解释观测到的热辐射，挑战传统冷却模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型预测中子星在10^7年内冷却到不可探测温度，但HST观测显示Gyr年老毫秒脉冲星和10^7-8年经典脉冲星仍有热辐射，需要加热机制解释。

Method: 计算中子星热演化，包括核心旋转化学加热（正常或Cooper配对物质）、内壳层涡旋蠕变、以及核反应壳层加热，并与观测比较。

Result: 单一机制无法解释所有源。PSR J0437-4715需要大Cooper配对间隙的旋转化学加热，但PSR B0950+08需要不现实的短初始周期。组合模型能同时匹配两个脉冲星。

Conclusion: 旋转化学加热与涡旋蠕变组合模型能解释观测数据，预测其他脉冲星温度接近上限，为未来观测提供验证机会。

Abstract: Passively cooling neutron stars (NSs) should reach undetectably low surface temperatures $T_s<10^4$ K in less than $10^7$ yr. However, HST observations have revealed likely thermal UV emission from the Gyr-old millisecond pulsars PSR~J0437$-$4715 and PSR~J2124$-$3358, and from the $\sim10^{7-8}$ yr-old classical pulsars PSR~B0950$+$08 and PSR~J0108$-$1431, implying $T_s\sim10^5$ K and the need for heating mechanisms. We compute the thermal evolution of these NSs including rotochemical heating (RH) in the core with normal or Cooper-paired matter, vortex creep (VC) in the inner crust, and crustal heating through nuclear reactions, and compare the results with observations and with the upper limit for PSR~2144$-$3933. No single mechanism explains all sources. The high temperature of PSR~J0437$-$4715 can be reproduced by RH with a large Cooper pairing gap $Δ_i\sim1.5$ MeV for either neutrons or protons, but this requires an unrealistically short initial period $P_0\lesssim1.8$ ms to activate the same mechanism in PSR~B0950$+$08. Conversely, the latter can be explained by RH with modified Urca reactions in normal matter or by VC with an excess angular momentum $J\sim3\times10^{43}$ erg,s, but these models underpredict PSR~J0437$-$4715. A model combining RH with a large pairing gap and VC matches both pulsars and is consistent with the upper limits for the remaining three. It further predicts that their temperatures should lie close to these limits, suggesting that deeper or broader-wavelength observations would provide a strong test of this scenario.

Conclusion: 该框架为解码未来银河系超新星的详细核心动力学和多信使过程提供了有价值的工具，揭示了爆炸热力学状态同时印记在中微子通量和能谱形状上。

Abstract: We introduce a novel parameterization of supernova neutrino energy spectra with a clear physical motivation. Its central parameter, $τ(t)$, quantifies the characteristic thermal-diffusion area during the explosion. When applied to the historic SN1987A data, this parameterization yields statistically significant fits and provides robust constraints on the unobserved low-energy portion of the spectrum. Beyond this specific application, we demonstrate the model's power on a suite of 3D core-collapse supernova simulations, finding that the temporal evolution of $τ(t)$ distinctly separates successful from failed explosions. Furthermore, we constrain the progenitor mass of SN 1987A to approximately 19 solar masses by applying Smoothed Isotonic Regression, while noting the sensitivity of this estimate to observational uncertainties. Moreover, in these simulations, $τ(t)$ and the gravitational-wave strain amplitude display a strong, synergistic co-evolution, directly linking the engine's energetic evolution to its geometric asymmetry. This implies that the thermodynamic state of the explosion is imprinted not only on the escaping neutrino flux, but also recorded in the shape of the energy spectrum. Our framework therefore offers a valuable tool for decoding the detailed core dynamics and multi-messenger processes of future galactic supernovae.

Method: 使用COSMIC二元种群合成代码和backpop采样技术，将GW190814的观测参数映射到零龄主序双星的初始条件，同时推断形成所需的共同包层演化、稳定质量转移和natal kick运动学等天体物理过程。

Result: 发现GW190814的初始条件与本地星系群观测到的大质量恒星种群没有显著差异。主导形成路径包括：第一次洛希瓣溢出涉及共同包层演化，第二次洛希瓣溢出保持稳定。natal kick在形成GW190814类系统中起关键作用。

Conclusion: natal kick的强度和方向对形成GW190814类系统至关重要，特别是第二次natal kick的方向需在轨道平面内指向系统质心，以增加轨道偏心率并缩短延迟时间，使系统能在哈勃时间内合并。估计约20%的系统可能经历这种幸运的natal kick。

Abstract: The asymmetric nature of GW190814, particularly its mass ratio ($q \approx 1/10$), has made its astrophysical origin elusive. We explore isolated binary evolution as a potential explanation for GW190814's formation. Using the binary population synthesis code COSMIC, and the backpop sampling technique to map the observed parameters of GW190814 to the initial conditions of Zero Age Main Sequence binary stars while simultaneously inferring the astrophysical prescriptions for common envelope evolution, stable mass transfer and natal kick kinematics that are needed for its formation and eventual merger. We find that the initial conditions for the binary stellar population that forms GW190814 do not stand out significantly from massive star populations observed in the Local Group. Our backpop simulations recover a dominant formation pathway where the first Roche overflow phase includes a common envelope evolution and the second Roche overflow phase remains stable. Our findings suggest that natal kicks imparted during compact object formation play the strongest role in forming GW190814-like systems. Specifically, our models require a low magnitude first natal kick (independent of direction) that prevents the binary from unbinding and a large second natal kick with its direction in the plane of the orbit and toward the binary's center of mass. The second natal kick strength and direction crucially increases the orbital eccentricity, leading to shorter delay times, and thus enabling mergers within a Hubble time. We estimate the chance probability for GW190814-like events that experience such a lucky kick and find that it occurs in $\sim20\%$ of systems if natal kicks are randomly oriented. We discuss the astrophysical implications for the formation of asymmetric GW190814-like systems under the context of binary stellar evolution.

TL;DR: 提出了一个在微引力透镜焦散线附近图像形成的制备不变解析描述方法，通过局部Weierstrass制备将透镜映射简化为单一测地变量，并利用超Catalan递推关系实现精确图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种能够精确描述微引力透镜焦散线附近多重图像形成的解析方法，特别是在复杂几何结构中保持计算精度和连续性。

Method: 使用局部Weierstrass制备将透镜映射简化为单一测地变量m，满足m=Uφ(m)关系，建立超Catalan递推关系进行系数计算，并结合牛顿抛光方法进行边界修正。

Result: 在二元折叠和尖点、人工十次曲线以及两个具有挑战性几何结构的三透镜尖点上，该方法能够以机器精度恢复精确图像，并在连续化过程中保持连续性。

Conclusion: 所提出的单级数模板方法为光度测量和天体测量建模提供了有效的解析工具，能够量化稀疏性、刚性和安全评估域。

Abstract: We give a preparation-invariant analytic description of image formation near microlensing caustics. After a local Weierstrass preparation at any multiple image (order $d\ge2$), the lens mapping reduces to a single geode variable $m$ satisfying $m=U\,\varphi(m)$, where $U$ is a prepared source coordinate and $\varphi$ is an image-side kernel. The coefficients of $m(U)$ obey closed Hyper-Catalan (HC) recurrences, allowing termwise derivatives and truncation control from the characteristic system. We also use the same form for a short HC predictor-corrector: evaluate the series within its certified radius and apply a brief Newton polish near the boundary. We define an HC signature (first nonzero kernel coefficients) and an HC spectrum (branch points and analyticity radius $ρ_U$), which quantify sparsity, stiffness, and safe evaluation domains. The construction covers folds and cusps of any global degree. On a binary fold and cusp, an artificial decic with a resonant unit, and two triple-lens cusps of a challenging geometry, HC seeds plus a few Newton steps recover the exact images to machine precision within the certified domain and maintain continuity under continuation. The resulting single-series templates (with $(\mathrm{Sig}_R,ρ_U)$ metadata) are ready for photometric and astrometric modeling.

Abstract: The classification of radio galaxies is central to understanding galaxy evolution, active galactic nuclei dynamics, and the large-scale structure of the universe. However, traditional manual techniques are inadequate for processing the massive, heterogeneous datasets generated by modern radio surveys. In this study, we present a probabilistic machine learning framework that integrates Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for feature extraction with Bayesian ensemble learning to achieve robust, scalable radio galaxy classification. The SVD approach effectively reduces dimensionality while preserving key morphological structures, enabling efficient representation of galaxy features. To mitigate class imbalance and avoid the introduction of artefacts, we incorporate a Local Neighbourhood Encoding strategy tailored to the astrophysical distribution of galaxy types. The resulting features are used to train and optimize several baseline classifiers: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, LightGBM, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons within bagging, boosting, and stacking ensembles governed by a Bayesian weighting scheme. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian ensembles outperform their traditional counterparts across all metrics, with the Bayesian stacking model achieving a classification accuracy of 99.0% and an F1-score of 0.99 across Compact, Bent, Fanaroff-Riley Type I (FR-I), and Type II (FR-II) sources. Interpretability is enhanced through SHAP analysis, which highlights the principal components most associated with morphological distinctions. Beyond improving classification performance, our framework facilitates uncertainty quantification, paving the way for more reliable integration into next-generation survey pipelines. This work contributes a reproducible and interpretable methodology for automated galaxy classification in the era of data-intensive radio astronomy.

Abstract: This paper optimizes the design and analysis of the mechanical test platform for the scientific probe module of the Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph, which is the fifth part of the China Space Station survey Telescope. First, according to the module layout and economic requirements, the preliminary structural design of the module mechanical test platform is carried out, and the stiffness sensitive parameters of the assembly are identified to determine the optimization parameters. The Central Composite Design method is used to design the test platform, and a third-order regression model is constructed for response surface analysis. The third-order response surface model of the fundamental frequency and amplitude of the test platform is obtained by fitting the test data with the least squares method, and the structure of the module mechanical test platform is determined. The modal analysis is carried out to determine the fundamental frequency and vibration modes of the mechanical test platform. The vibration response of the platform is simulated by sine, random and swept frequency vibration simulations. The response surface fitting algorithm is verified by the test platform swept frequency test. The agreement between the response surface fitting algorithm and the experiment is good. The fundamental frequency of the test platform is 436.2Hz (>300Hz), which meets the design index requirements of the test platform and can accurately guide the optimization design work. At the same time, it provides the theoretical basis and design method for the structural design of the Chinese manned space station.

Abstract: The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) Balloon with Radio (PBR) is an instrument designed to be borne by a NASA suborbital Super Pressure Balloon (SPB), in a mission planned to last as long as 50 days. The PBR instrument consists of a 1.1 m aperture Schmidt telescope, similar to the POEMMA design, with two cameras in its hybrid focal surface: a Fluorescence Camera (FC) and a Cherenkov Camera (CC), both mounted on a frame that can be tilted to point from nadir up to 13 degrees above the horizon. The FC camera is designed to detect the fluorescence emission of Extensive Air Showers produced by Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays from sub-orbital altitudes. This measurement will validate the detection strategy for future space-based missions, such as POEMMA. The FC will be made of 4 Photo Detection Modules (PDMs), each consisting of a 6x6 matrix of 64-channel Multi Anode PhotoMulTipliers (MAPMT), for a grand total of 2304 pixels for each PDM. Custom-designed SPACIROC-3 ASICs perform single photoelectron counting on each pixel as well as charge integration on groups of 8 pixels to measure extremely bright or fast signals, reaching a double pulse resolution in the order of 10 ns for a 1 microsecond acquisition gate. A field flattener lens and a BG3 filter, to match the wavelength range of interest (300-400 nm), are mounted in front of the PDM. The camera will be able to detect showers in a field of view of 24x24 square degrees, with a pixel size on ground corresponding to 115 m. Details on the camera design and implementation will be given, along with the expected performance and the state of the construction.

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代再电离时代约束提供了通用的高效模拟器构建策略，使高维模型推断变得可行。

Abstract: Constraining the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) with physically motivated simulations is hampered by the high cost of conventional parameter inference. We present an efficient emulator-based framework that dramatically reduces this bottleneck for the photon-conserving semi-numerical code SCRIPT. Our approach combines (i) a reliable coarse-resolution MCMC to locate the high-likelihood region (exploiting the large-scale convergence of SCRIPT) with (ii) an adaptive, targeted sampling strategy to build a compact high-resolution training set for an artificial neural network based emulator of the model likelihood. With only $\approx 10^3$ high-resolution simulations, the trained emulators achieve excellent predictive accuracy ($R^2 \approx 0.97$--$0.99$) and, when embedded within an MCMC framework, reproduce posterior distributions from full high-resolution runs. Compared to conventional MCMC, our pipeline reduces the number of expensive simulations by a factor of $\sim 100$ and lowers total CPU cost by up to a factor of $\sim 70$, while retaining statistical fidelity. This computational speedup makes inference in much higher-dimensional models tractable (e.g., those needed to incorporate JWST and upcoming 21 cm datasets) and provides a general strategy for building efficient emulators for next generation of EoR constraints.

TL;DR: WFC3/UVIS探测器的电荷转移效率(CTE)随时间持续下降，低信号水平下降更快。CTE下降率更适合用二次或三次函数拟合，而非线性函数。残差分析显示存在8-9年的周期性振荡。

Motivation: 监测WFC3/UVIS探测器CTE随时间的变化趋势，评估其性能退化情况，为仪器校准和数据分析提供参考。

Method: 使用扩展像素边缘响应(EPER)技术分析2009-2025年的内部校准数据，比较线性、二次和三次函数对CTE下降率的拟合效果，并对残差进行Lomb-Scargle周期图分析。

Result: CTE持续下降，最低信号水平(160e-)每年下降0.0001，累计下降0.0015。二次函数拟合残差最小，三次函数拟合优度最佳。残差存在8-9年的周期性振荡。

Conclusion: WFC3/UVIS的CTE退化符合预期，但下降率更适合用非线性函数描述，且存在周期性变化模式，这对仪器性能建模和校准具有重要意义。

Abstract: In this report, we examine the behavior of Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) on the WFC3/UVIS detector over time as computed by the Extended Pixel Edge Response (EPER) technique, using internal calibration data acquired from 2009 through 2025. We find that the CTE has continued to decline as expected, with a steeper loss rate for lower signal levels. The lowest signal level (160e-) has continued to decline at a rate of 0.0001 per year, with a total overall decline of 0.0015. Analyses from 2016 and 2020 found that the rate of decline was not well fit by a linear function. This report verifies the rate of decline is instead better fit by a quadratic function (which results in the smallest min. and max. residuals, on average) or a cubic function (which has the best "goodness of fit" $χ^2$ and $R^2$ values). We continue to see periodic oscillations of the residuals around all three fit lines (linear, quadratic, and cubic) on which we perform a Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis of the residuals. We find a periodicity of about 8 years for the residuals around the linear fit lines and about 9 years for the quadratic and cubic fit lines.

Motivation: 评估WFC3仪器在其整个寿命期间（2009-2024）与Gaia DR3星表对齐的几何畸变线性项的时间稳定性，特别是识别任何系统性偏移或不确定性增加的时期。

Method: 使用MAST流水线的WFC3/IR到Gaia DR3对齐解决方案，分析线性几何畸变项（旋转、倾斜、尺度和偏移）的相对偏移，并与WFC3/UVIS的先前分析结果进行比较。

Result: 发现2018-2021年间旋转项和倾斜项的不确定性和偏移增加，与抖动增加时期对应；旋转、倾斜和尺度偏移没有显著线性时间演化；但偏移项（IDCTAB与Gaia WCS位置差异）显示时间演化，主要由望远镜指向不准确性主导。

Conclusion: WFC3/IR几何畸变解决方案与Gaia DR3在旋转、倾斜和尺度方面保持稳定，但偏移项受外部指向误差影响；建议需要高精度天体测量的观测者使用tweakreg程序验证或改进图像对齐。

Abstract: We examine the relative offsets of the linear terms in the geometric distortion between WFC3/IR and the Gaia DR3 catalog using the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) pipeline WFC3/IR to Gaia DR3 alignment solutions to assess temporal stability over the lifetime of the WFC3 instrument (2009-2024). We find a period of increased uncertainty and offsets in the rotation term between 2018 and 2021, as seen in a previous analysis of WFC3/UVIS linear geometric distortion (O'Connor et al., 2024), corresponding with a period of increased jitter. We find a similar pattern of increased uncertainty between 2018 and 2021 in the skew offsets to Gaia DR3, as well. We find no significant linear temporal evolution in the rotation, skew, or scale offsets between the WFC3/IR IDCTAB distortion solution and Gaia DR3 over the 16-year lifetime of the WFC3 instrument; however, we do see temporal evolution in the shift offsets (the difference -in pixels- between the IDCTAB and Gaia WCS positions), which are dominated by telescope pointing inaccuracy external to the WFC3/IR geometric distortion solution. For observers requiring high-precision astrometry, we continue to recommend that observers verify or improve image alignment using the tweakreg routine.

Result: 单引导星模式下：短曝光（<500秒）PSF质量与双引导星模式无差异；长曝光（~2500秒）漂移量在4/5情况下小于0.2像素，1/5情况下约0.4像素；通过扰动PSF后处理可基本消除所有天体测量残差。

Conclusion: 单引导星模式虽然存在轻微漂移，但对大多数科学项目影响可忽略，且可通过后处理有效校正，为哈勃望远镜提供了可靠的备用观测模式。

Abstract: HST is designed to use two guide stars (GSs) in the fine-guidance sensors (FGSs) to maintain its pointing and tracking during exposures. The primary GS holds the boresight fixed and the secondary GS keeps the orientation fixed. However, HST is also able to track using only a single GS by fixing the boresite on one star and maintaining the orientation using the available gyro(s). We evaluate the pointing quality achieved in this latter case, when one GS and one gyro (RGM, a.k.a., reduced gyro mode) are used. We find that in 1GS-RGM, there is indeed more drift during the course of an orbit than when two guide stars are used, but the drift is much smaller than was seen in previous times of sub-optimal gyro performance. We quantify the 1GS-RGM drift seen in recent archival GO data and in images from a test calibration program and find that (a) for exposures < 500 sec, the PSF quality in 1GS is indistinguishable from that of 2GS and (b) over the course of full orbits (~2500 sec), the drift in four of five cases was less than 0.2 pixel and ~0.4 pix in the other case. Such a drift is marginally detectable in observations, but it should have a marginal impact on most science programs, since the variation in the PSF caused by drift is smaller than the PSF variations with focus and with location on the detector. For observers who wish to correct drift effects, we show that the use of a perturbed PSF during post-acquisition data analysis removes essentially all astrometric residuals, even for drift levels up to ~0.5 pix, as well as most of the photometric residuals.

Abstract: In recent years, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) have emerged as promising platforms for optical interferometry through the use of intensity interferometry. IACTs combine large segmented mirrors, photodetectors with nanosecond-scale time response capable of detecting signals from just a few photo-electrons, and array configurations with baselines of hundreds of meters. As a result, all major IACT facilities have now been upgraded to function also as optical intensity interferometers, achieving sensitivities an order of magnitude better than their predecessor, the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer. However, further improvements in sensitivity are currently limited by key IACT design constraints, namely the combination of poor optical quality and small focal ratios. Here we present three practical implementations of the "I3T concept", in which segments of the IACT primary mirror are focused onto different pixels of its camera. This approach yields several unexpected but significant advantages. Optics with larger focal ratios allow to integrate narrow-band optical filters, while lower photon fluxes enable to deploy next-generation photodetectors operating in photon-counting mode. We demonstrate that this so-called "Butterfly's Eye" configuration enhances the sensitivity of IACT-based intensity interferometers by a factor between 4 and 6. Moreover, as originally envisioned, the I3T design introduces imaging capabilities on angular scales from 2 to 40 milliarcseconds, unlocking new scientific opportunities such as direct surface imaging of nearby red giants. Besides, realistic simulations show that it can have a transformative impact on at least two key science cases: imaging the earliest stages of nova ejecta, and measuring the oblateness and circumstellar disks of fast-rotating stars.

Abstract: Extracting polarimetric information from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data is demanding but vital for understanding the synchrotron radiation process and the magnetic fields of celestial objects, such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, conventional CLEAN-based calibration and imaging methods provide suboptimal resolution without uncertainty estimation of calibration solutions, while requiring manual steering from an experienced user. We present a Bayesian polarization calibration and imaging method using Bayesian imaging software resolve for VLBI data sets, that explores the posterior distribution of antenna-based gains, polarization leakages, and polarimetric images jointly from pre-calibrated data. We demonstrate our calibration and imaging method with observations of the quasar 3C273 with the VLBA at 15 GHz and the blazar OJ287 with the GMVA+ALMA at 86 GHz. Compared to the CLEAN method, our approach provides physically realistic images that satisfy positivity of flux and polarization constraints and can reconstruct complex source structures composed of various spatial scales. Our method systematically accounts for calibration uncertainties in the final images and provides uncertainties of Stokes images and calibration solutions. The automated Bayesian approach for calibration and imaging will be able to obtain high-fidelity polarimetric images using high-quality data from next-generation radio arrays. The pipeline developed for this work is publicly available.
