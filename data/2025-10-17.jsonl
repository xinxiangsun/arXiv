Comment Welcome", "summary": "We investigate magnetic-field amplification driven by the nonresonant hybrid\n(NRH or Bell) instability and its impact on cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration at\nreverse shocks of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei (AGN).\nPrevious kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that\nwhen maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently\namplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of\nNRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is\ncarried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional\nMHD--CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion--convection equations to\ntrace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under\nrealistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field\nstrength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\\!\\lesssim\\!10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{G}$),\nNRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a\nself-regulated state where $E_{\\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength\nof magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields\n($B_{0}\\!\\gtrsim\\!10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to\ndrive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through\nparametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We\ngive the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for\nPeV--EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks."}

By leveraging the\nrepresentational power of deep neural networks, SBI can extract the most\ninformative simulation features for the parameters of interest.

This is typically\nimplemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network\ntraining alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well\nsuited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are\ncommonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing\nmodel fidelity.

To maintain realism for\nsecular timescales, simulations must avoid accumulated errors from drifts in\nconserved quantities and artificial heating, and they must model turbulent\ntransport in a way that remains plausible throughout the evolution. It is also\ncrucial to avoid numerical artifacts due to the polar coordinate axis\nsingularity. Methods that behave well near the axis often break\nflux-conservative form of the hydrodynamic equations, resulting in significant\ndrifts in conserved quantities. We present a flux-conservative scheme that\nmaintains smoothness near the axis without sacrificing conservative formulation\nof the equations or incurring drifts in conserved global quantities. We compare\nthe numerical performance of different treatments of the hydrodynamic equations\nwhen evolving a hypermassive neutron star resembling the remnant of a BNS\nmerger.

Most studies argue that these afterglows may\narise from forward shocks (FS) produced by the interaction between the TDE\noutflow and the hot, diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM). Current theoretical\nmodels do not model the evolution of relativistic electrons in space, which\nintroduces uncertainties. Here we conducted hydrodynamic simulations to study\nthe hydrodynamic evolution of relativistic electrons, and calculated the\nsynchrotron spectra via radiative transfer. We focus on the FS scenario with\nnon-relativistic outflows, and various parameters of the outflow and CNM are\nexplored. A moderate outflow with kinetic energy of several $10^{50}$ erg in a\nGalactic center - like CNM can produce mJy-level radio afterglows at a distance\nof 100 Mpc. The self-absorption frequency exhibits a slow decline at early\ntimes and a rapid decrease at late times. We derived the temporal evolution of\nthe high-frequency radio flux, revealing its characteristic rise and decline\npattern. We also find that: (1) the radio spectra for narrow outflows are\nclearly anisotropic along different sight lines; (2) the FS parameters inferred\nfrom radio spectra using conventional analytical formulas deviate significantly\nfrom those in simulations, in which the inferred shock radii are half of those\nfrom simulations, and the inferred energies are an order of magnitude lower."}

In keeping with the\nevolving landscape of SETI research, the IAA Declaration of Principles was\nstreamlined and updated in 2010. Recognising the need for continued adaptation,\nthe IAA SETI Committee established a Task Group in 2022 to re-examine the\nprotocols in light of recent advances in search methodologies, the expansion of\ninternational participation in SETI, and the increasing complexity of the\nglobal information environment. The Group recognises the living document nature\nof the protocols, which will require ongoing refinement to remain relevant and\neffective in a rapidly changing world. A draft revised Declaration of\nPrinciples was presented at the IAC 2024 in Milan, and initial feedback was\nreceived from the community, particularly members of the IAA SETI Committee.\nSince then, we have continued to seek broader community input in a structured\nprocess, refining the proposed updates based on further discussions and\nconsultations.

This is\nparticularly relevant to the cooling flow problem--the lack of star formation\nrelative to X-ray-inferred ICM cooling rates. Using ZwCl 3146, a relaxed CC\nsystem at $z = 0.291$, we compare pressure profiles derived via X-rays and the\nthermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. While SZ measurements probe only\nthermal ICM electrons, additional CR-IC emission would appear to boost the\nX-ray-inferred pressure. Relative to unity, we measure a $\\simeq30\\%$ decrement\nin $P_{SZ}/P_X$ within 100 kpc of the ZwCl 3146 center at a statistical\nsignificance of $\\simeq 3.3\\sigma$, consistent with predicted deficits from\nCR-IC contamination in reasonable models of central AGN-driven CR injection.\nX-ray spectral fits of a two-component model with thermal ICM and CR-IC\nemission are consistent with CR-IC as the cause of this deficit. We test\nalternative explanations and systematics that could drive such a decrement,\nwith the leading order systematics associated with halo triaxiality.\nCollectively, these systematics are unlikely to produce a $P_{SZ}/P_X$\ndecrement $\\gtrsim10\\%$. While our results establish that non-negligible CR-IC\nemission is plausible in ZwCl 3146, we stress that more detailed studies of\nlarger cluster samples are required to robustly assess whether CR-IC is\nrelevant to the cooling flow problem."}

The interpretation of these signals\nrelies heavily on accurate numerical-relativity simulations that incorporate\nthe relevant microphysical processes. Using the latest updates of the BAM code,\nwe perform general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of\nbinary neutron star mergers with two different spin configurations. We adopt a\nstate-of-the-art equation of state based on relativistic mean-field theory\ndeveloped for dense matter in neutron star mergers.
