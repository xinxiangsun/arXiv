A few observed\nsources that could not be detected in the deconvolved image are found near\nsaturated sources, whereas for others, the deconvolved counterparts are\ndetected when slightly different detection parameters are used. The\ndeconvolution reveals new faint sources previously undetectable, which are\nconfirmed by crossmatching with the deeper DESI Legacy DR10 and with\nPan-STARRS1 through forced photometry.

Reaching this precision requires mitigating variable\natmospheric effects, especially gray extinction from clouds, which remains a\nmajor challenge. To address this challenge, we present a novel method for\ncorrecting photometric data using simultaneous radiometric measurements from an\ninfrared thermal camera. The gray extinction correction model is fitted on an\nimage-by-image basis as a function of thermal radiance excess and difference\nbetween synthetic and instrumental fluxes of calibration stars. This approach\nstands out by avoiding any assumptions about spatial structure and leveraging a\nforward model combining in situ environmental monitoring, radiative transfer\nsimulations and use of Gaia Data Release 3 star catalogs. We demonstrate the\nmethod using data collected from a dedicated experimental remote observation\nsystem, built to conduct repeated observations of two fields over several\nnights in varying atmosphere conditions. We show that applying the correction\nmodel to each source in the test sample results in a reduction of residuals\nbetween corrected and reference magnitudes. It delivers extinction correction\nmaps for individual images with a resolution of 2 arcmin and an accuracy of\n$\\sim$0.01 mag. This leads to a significant improvement in accuracy per image,\nwith the mean absolute error decreasing from 0.64 to 0.11 mag for the most gray\nextinguished exposures. The temporal variations in extinction for non-ideal\nphotometric sequences can be reduced to 0.025 mag per source, which is\npromising for its application in StarDICE."}

Using a small\ntransformer-based model and refined light curve encoding logic, we present a\nnew state of the art classification performance on ELAsTiCC, with 71.8% F1 on\nLC-only classifications, and 89.8% F1 on LC+metadata classifications.

This study presents the implementation of the One-Fluid model in\nOpenGadget3, introducing improvements to the original formulation. These\nenhancements include time-dependent artificial viscosity and conductivity, as\nwell as a novel treatment of dust diffusion using a pressure-like term. The\nimproved model is tested using a suite of dust dynamics benchmark problems:\nDUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK, with the latter extended to\nmultidimensional scenarios, as well as a dusty Sedov-Taylor blast wave.\nAdditional tests include simulations of Cold Keplerian Disks, dusty\nprotoplanetary disks, and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities to evaluate the\nmodel's robustness in more complex flows. The implementation successfully\npasses all standard benchmark tests. It demonstrates stability and accuracy in\nboth simple and complex simulations. The new diffusion term improves the\nhandling of flows with large dust-to-gas ratios and low drag coefficients,\nalthough limitations of the One-Fluid model in these regimes remain. The\nenhanced One-Fluid model is a reliable and robust tool for simulating dust\ndynamics in OpenGadget3.

In addition to providing detailed views\nof the sloshing spiral, imaging and spectroscopic analysis reveals ICM\nsubstructure related to the merger history including a broad ``splash'' of\ncooler gas and a potential merger shock. The radio lobes of the central WAT\nsource show evidence of alignment with the sloshing motions, consistent with\nICM bulk flow, rather than host-galaxy motion, being the primary driver of lobe\nbending. Comparison to a 1:10 mass-ratio off-axis merger simulation indicates\nthat the observed ICM structures are relics of a second core passage of a\nsubcluster ~4 Gyr after the start of the merger, where the ``splash'' feature\nis revealed to be a wake of cool gas trailing behind the subcluster.

These CRs will\nseverely degrade image quality and further influence scientific analysis. Due\nto the CSST's sky survey strategy, traditional multi-frame stacking methods\nbecome invalid. The limited revisits prompted us to develop an effective\nsingle-image CR processing method for CSST. We retrained the DeepCR model based\non CSST simulated images and achieved 97.90+-0.18% recall and 98.67+-0.05%\nprecision on CR detection. Moreover, this paper puts forward an innovative\nmorphology-sensitive inpainting method, which focuses more on areas with higher\nscientific value. We trained a UNet++ model especially on contaminated\nstellar/galactic areas, alongside adaptive median filtering for background\nregions. This method achieves effective for CRs with different intensities and\ndifferent distances from centers of scientific targets. By this approach, the\nphotometric errors of CR-corrected targets could be restricted to the level\ncomparable to those of uncontaminated sources. Also, it increases the detection\nrate by 13.6% compared to CR masking. This method will provide a robust CR\nmitigation for next-generation space telescopes."}

Within the\nstandard disk-corona model, we assume that protons are accelerated by a\nnon-resonant acceleration mechanism driven by magnetized turbulence in the\ncorona. These accelerated protons interact with ambient radiation or matter,\nproducing high-energy neutrinos and gamma rays. In this scenario, gamma rays\nare largely absorbed within the corona. The neutrino luminosity depends\nprimarily on the properties of the corona (such as the X-ray luminosity and\nradius) and the spectral energy distribution of the target photons. This study\ndemonstrates the relation between the neutrino luminosity and the X-ray\nluminosity, and further discusses the contribution of cascade gamma rays to\ncoronal radiation. Notably, MeV gamma rays can effectively escape the source,\ntogether with neutrinos, and serve as key observational probes for testing this\nmodel. Future MeV gamma-ray telescopes, such as AMEGO-X and e-ASTROGAM, are\nexpected to detect such gamma-ray signatures, providing a critical\nmulti-messenger test of the hadronic corona model."}

Directly imaging an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star\nrequires reaching 10$^{-10}$ contrast levels and will be the goal of the\nHabitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). A key technical barrier to reaching such\ndeep contrasts is maintaining wavefront stability on the order of tens of\npicometers, in particular in the presence of a segmented primary mirror. Keck\nObservatory is the only facility with all of the hardware components necessary\nfor validating HWO segment phasing strategies: a large segmented primary\nmirror, capacitive edge sensors, deformable mirror, Zernike wavefront sensor\n(ZWFS), and high contrast science instruments. Taking advantage of these\nparallels, we are using Keck as a testbed for developing and validating HWO\nwavefront sensing and control loop strategies, as well as demonstrating the\nfull system-level segment control architecture for HWO, using existing\ninfrastructure. Recently, we set the stage for this work by using the ZWFS\ninstalled on the Keck II telescope to sense and correct the primary mirror\nsegment pistons in closed-loop in parallel with science observations. This\nresulted in improved Strehl ratios on the NIRC2 science camera (Salama et al.\n2024a). We now aim to directly address concerns related to control authority,\nactuator offload, and loop stability - tasks which require Keck's existing\ninfrastructure, but which do not require picometer wavefront stability.\nMoreover, successful comparisons of observed and predicted performances will\nvalidate, on a real operating observatory, the HWO error budget methodology and\nin particular its approach to nested loops operating at multiple timescales."}

In this work, we search for these neutrinos using $\\sim$9 years of\nIceCube-DeepCore data with an event selection optimized for energies between 15\nGeV to 200 GeV. We considered several annihilation and decay channels and dark\nmatter masses ranging from 15 GeV up to 8 TeV. No significant deviation from\nthe background expectation from atmospheric neutrinos and muons was found. The\nmost significant result was found for a dark matter mass of 201.6 GeV\nannihilating into a pair of $b\\bar{b}$ quarks assuming the Navarro-Frenk-White\nhalo profile with a post-trial significance of $1.08 \\;\\sigma$. We present\nupper limits on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section of the order\nof $10^{-24} \\mathrm{cm}^3 \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, as well as lower limits on the\ndark matter decay lifetime up to $10^{26} \\mathrm{s}$ for dark matter masses\nbetween 5 GeV up to 8 TeV. These results strengthen the current IceCube limits\non dark matter masses above 20 GeV and provide an order of magnitude\nimprovement at lower masses. In addition, they represent the strongest\nconstraints from any neutrino telescope on GeV-scale dark matter and are among\nthe world-leading limits for several dark matter scenarios."}

Together, these\nstudies establish the scientific foundation for next-generation X-ray\nexploration in the 2030s and highlight strong synergies with facilities of the\n2030s, such as JWST, Roman, Rubin/LSST, SKA, ALMA, ngVLA, and next-generation\ngravitational-wave and neutrino networks."}

Presented at the 39th International\n  Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025), 2025", "summary": "The Seyfert Type II galaxy NGC 1068 has been identified as a potential\nneutrino source by IceCube, with a 4.2$\\sigma $ significance detection of a\n79$^{+22}_{-20}$ neutrino excess from 2011 to 2020, despite the absence of a\ngamma-ray counterpart. The observed high-energy neutrino emission indicates the\npresence of a hadronic component, along with strong gamma-ray absorption,\nlikely via pair production, and efficient particle acceleration. In this work,\nwe investigate turbulence-driven magnetic reconnection as a mechanism for\nparticle acceleration in the coronal accretion flow surrounding the central\nblack hole. We develop a one-zone model for both acceleration and emission,\nfollowing the framework of de Gouveia Dal Pino and Lazarian (2005) and Kadowaki\net al. (2015) to explore how fast magnetic reconnection in the inner coronal\ndisk region accelerates protons and electrons, shaping the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED). Our model incorporates strong pair production attenuation\nand interactions with optical, ultraviolet (OUV), and X-ray photon fields in\nthe corona, which serve as effective targets for proton interactions. Unlike\nrecent studies, we find that particle acceleration to the extreme energies\nrequired to explain observations is primarily driven by first-order Fermi\nacceleration within the turbulent reconnection layers in a large scale current\nsheet, rather than by drift acceleration. Additionally, we demonstrate that\naccelerated protons primarily lose energy through photopion interactions with\nthe OUV background, subject to important constraints from the coronal X-ray\nemission."}

The internal\nstructures and properties of those objects are profoundly connected to\nphenomena such as supernova explosions, gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts,\nhigh/low-mass compact stars, and even to issues like dark matter and cosmic\nrays. However, due to the non-perturbative nature of quantum chromodynamics,\nsignificant uncertainties remain in our current understanding of the\ncomposition and equation of state (EOS) for the dense matter inside them.\nDrawing on three-flavour symmetry and the strong coupling between light quarks,\nthis paper presents a novel perspective on the nature of pulsars: they are\nactually composed of strange matter, in the form of either strange quark matter\nor strangeon (analogous to nucleons and representing multibaryon states with\nthree-flavour symmetry) matter. As both strange quark matter and strangeon\nmatter contain non-zero strangeness, we refer to them collectively as ``strange\nmatter'', and to the corresponding compact stars as ``strange stars''. We then\nbriefly introduce several physical models describing strange matter and present\nthe resulting structures and properties of strange stars. This includes\ndiscussions on the EOSs, surface properties, mass-radius relations, glitches,\nbinary compact star mergers, and dark matter. Furthermore, we will explore how\nobservational properties of pulsar-like objects support the strange star model."}

However, recent studies have challenged\nthis interpretation, suggesting that the compact companion is unlikely to be a\nblack hole. In this study, we revisit the nature of MWC 656 by analyzing\narchival data across multiple wavelengths, including radio observations from\nthe VLA, optical astrometry from the Gaia satellite, and high-energy\n$\\gamma$-ray data from the Fermi-LAT. Using all available VLA observations at\nX-band (8.0-12.0 GHz), we produce the deepest radio map toward this system to\ndate, with a noise level of 780 nJy beam$^{-1}$. The source MWC 656 is detected\nwith $S_\\nu=4.6\\pm0.8\\mu$Jy and a spectral index of $\\alpha=1.2\\pm1.8$, derived\nby sub-band imaging. The radio and X-ray luminosity ratio of MWC 656 is\nconsistent with both the fundamental plane of accreting black holes and with\nthe G\\\"udel-Benz relation for magnetically active stars, leaving the emission\nmechanism ambiguous. The optical astrometric results of MWC 656 indicate a\npeculiar velocity of $11.2\\pm2.3$ km s$^{-1}$, discarding it as a runaway star.\nIts current location, 442 pc below the Galactic plane, implies a vertical\ntravel time incompatible with the lifetime of a B1.5-type star. Moreover, the\nagreement between observed and expected motion in all three velocity components\nargues against a deceleration scenario, suggesting that MWC 656 likely formed\nin situ at high Galactic latitude. We carried out maximum likelihood analysis\nof Fermi-LAT data, but cannot report a significant detection of $\\gamma$-ray\nemission from this source. These results reinforce recent evidence that\nchallenge the black hole companion interpretation, and favor a non-BH compact\nobject such as a white dwarf or neutron star."}

However, this property\nis not fundamental to the theory. We demonstrate that for planar shocks with an\noblique magnetic field the generation of power-law spectra critically requires\nthe particles' scattering rate to be both directly proportional to their gyro\nradius (Bohm scaling) and spatially uniform. Non-Bohm scaling results in curved\nspectra at oblique shocks, while abrupt changes in the spatial profile of the\nscattering upstream introduces spectral breaks.

In this work, we present EVA--01, a novel equation of state that\nprovides a unified description of dense matter by incorporating both hadron and\nquark degrees of freedom within a single relativistic mean-field Lagrangian,\nfrom which the equation of state is derived at finite temperature. The model\nextends the density-dependent formalism by introducing a Polyakov-loop-inspired\nscalar field to dynamically govern the hadron-quark phase transition, following\nthe approach of chiral mean-field models. The resulting model is consistent\nwith a wide range of theoretical and observational constraints, including those\nfrom chiral effective field theory, massive pulsars, gravitational-wave events,\nand NICER data. We analyze its thermodynamic properties by constructing the QCD\nphase diagram, identifying the deconfinement, chiral, and nuclear liquid-gas\ntransitions. As a first application, we model the evolution of proto-neutron\nstars using isentropic snapshots and explore the implications of the slow\nstable hybrid star hypothesis.
