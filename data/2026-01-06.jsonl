We describe the landscape of source and gas properties that are expected to form H, He I and He II emission lines, and map spectral types to the parameter space of luminosity and system radius. Using one-dimensional radiative transfer calculations, we show that high source luminosities ($L > 10^{44}\\,\\rm erg~s^{-1}$) and compact ejecta radii ($r < 10^{14}\\,\\rm cm$) produce featureless spectra due to the high temperature and ionization state of the emitting medium. Intermediate luminosities and moderately compact systems can generate He II-dominated spectra, while lower luminosities and more extended atmospheres result in conspicuous H and He I emission. Large expansion velocities ($v \\geq 0.1c$) can further broaden lines such that they blend into the continuum. Featureless UV spectra may require even more extreme ionization conditions or velocities to suppress the many intrinsically strong metal lines at those wavelengths. Applying this framework to understand the absence of features observed in LFBOTs and featureless TDEs, we find that non-homologous, compact outflows are likely necessary for featurelessness to persist in optical and UV spectra."}

Ultra heavy ions ($Z \\gg 26$) can be accelerated to cosmic ray energies by the reverse shock as the ejecta decelerates by interacting with the ambient environment. We investigate the contribution of magnetars to the local ultra heavy cosmic ray flux using semi-analytic Galactic transport calculations, demonstrating that they may be significant contributors throughout Galactic history depending on the giant flare rate and ion acceleration efficiency. Although neutron star mergers inject orders of magnitude more energy into cosmic rays, they rarely occur within the spallation-limited propagation horizon for ultra heavy species, reducing their local contributions. As compared to lighter nuclei which are dominantly accelerated by supernovae, the SuperTIGER experiment has presented tentative evidence for a distinct contribution to the cosmic ray abundances near and above the first $r$-process peak ($Z \\approx 35\\text{--}56$). We argue that current abundance data are consistent with either a magnetar giant flare or neutron star merger origin for these species.

In this system, two distinct modes of density fluctuations, referred to as the charged mode and the neutral mode, are theoretically expected to arise through parametric instabilities. Our simulations confirm these predictions: in the charged mode, the electron and positron densities fluctuate oppositely (Langmuir-like), while in the neutral mode, the charge is Debye-screened and both species fluctuate in phase (acoustic-like). The linear growth rates obtained from the simulations are in good agreement with analytical estimates for both modes. We also find that, in some cases, the linear growth saturates before full scattering occurs, allowing the incident wave to propagate without significant attenuation. Our results allow us to determine whether induced Compton scattering grows linearly in magnetized pair plasmas, offering a foundation for studies of fast radio bursts and laser-plasma experiments."}

The absence of Balmer features indicates that the SN exploded within hydrogen-poor circumstellar matter (CSM). Together with the lack of explicit evidence of helium signatures, we tentatively identify SN 2024abvb as a Type Icn SN (SN Icn). After correcting for extinction, we estimate an r-band peak absolute magnitude of -19.7, placing SN 2024abvb in the luminous regime of SNe Icn. We adopted a hybrid model that accounts for both the energy released by the ejecta-CSM interaction and the radioactive decay of nickel synthesized in the SN ejecta to fit the light curve of SN 2024abvb. The best-fit model to the multiband light curves within the first ~ 40 days after explosion suggests that the CSM, radioactive nickel, and ejecta masses to be 0.28 Msun, 3.54 * 10-3 Msun, and 0.12 Msun, respectively. Such a low ejecta mass indicates that the progenitor star of SN 2024abvb experienced a significant mass-stripping process, consistent with the hydrogen-poor and helium-poor spectral features.

A key development is a nonlinear neutrino-matter coupling algorithm based on nested fixed-point iteration with Anderson acceleration, enabling fully implicit treatment of collisional processes, including energy-coupling interactions such as neutrino-electron scattering and pair production. Coupling to finite-volume (FV) hydrodynamics is achieved with a hybrid DG-FV representation of the fluid variables and operator-split evolution in Flash-X. The implementation is verified using basic transport tests with idealized opacities and relaxation and deleptonization problems with tabulated microphysics. Spherically symmetric CCSN simulations demonstrate accuracy and robustness of the coupled scheme, including close agreement with the CCSN simulation code Chimera. An axisymmetric CCSN simulation further demonstrates the viability of DG-based neutrino transport for multidimensional supernova modeling within Flash-X. thornado's neutrino-transport solver is GPU-enabled using OpenMP offloading or OpenACC, and all CCSN applications included in this work use the GPU implementation.

We present a convolutional neural network framework designed for real-time detection and multi-mode frequency extraction of post-merger signals, achieving an inference latency of 3.0 ms and a frequency accuracy of 48.6 Hz on the direct-comparison subsets (53 Hz on the comprehensive test set). The framework is validated on realistic LIGO O4 detector noise including authentic GravitySpy glitch morphologies, demonstrating ROC AUC of 0.999999 and 99.998% detection efficiency at 1% false alarm rate. These exceptional performance metrics arise from an aggressive training augmentation strategy that exposes the network to artificially challenging conditions, enabling robust generalization to our synthetic O4 detector noise model. We compare performance against a simplified matched filtering baseline using Lorentzian templates (23x more accurate despite a 4.7x computational overhead) and Bayesian parameter estimation (1.2 million times faster), establishing complementary trade-offs in the analysis landscape. While current O4 sensitivity limits post-merger detections to ~20 Mpc (~1 detection per century), this methodology provides essential infrastructure for third-generation detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer) where post-merger detection will become routine with annual detection rates exceeding 100 events. Our validation framework identifies expected behavior in uncertainty scaling that reflects realistic training constraints rather than idealized Fisher information limits, demonstrating honest assessment practices for machine learning applications in gravitational wave astronomy."}

This is large enough to mimic or obscure planetary signatures. To isolate and correct these effects, we develop a suite of diagnostics that track two-dimensional échellogram shifts, scalings, and rotation, as well as line bisector spans (LBS) derived from laser frequency comb (LFC) lines. By combining these empirical tracers with instrument telemetry in a multi-dimensional regression, we reduce the EXPRES instrument trend traced with solar RVs from an RMS of 1.32 m/s to 0.43 m/s, a 67% improvement, and the aggregate of twelve chromospherically quiet stars show a 26% reduction in velocity scatter. Our injection-recovery simulations further demonstrate a doubling in sensitivity to low-amplitude planetary signals after correction.

Archival XMM-Newton observations of 12 active galactic nuclei were analyzed to constrain properties of these absorbers. Our analysis demonstrates that the soft X-ray variability is primarily governed by fluctuation of the partial covering fraction of mildly ionized clumpy clouds. In particular, for Mrk 335, PDS 456, and 1H 0707-495, outflow velocities of the clumpy absorbers are constrained from the blue-shifts of the Fe-L edge structure. The blue-shifted Fe-L edge successfully reproduces the well-known complex spectral feature near 1 keV in 1H 0707--495, which was often explained by invoking an ad hoc absorption structure. Notably, the inferred outflow velocities of the clumpy absorbers are comparable to, or even exceed, those associated with the Ultra-Fast Outflows (UFOs). Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the outflow velocities and the intrinsic X-ray fluxes in two of four data sets, and the remaining two datasets also agree with this positive correlation, which supports a radiative-driven wind scenario that the X-ray/UV emission from the central black holes is causing the UFOs and the outflowing clumpy absorbers. In addition, the line-driven acceleration is likely playing a significant role, since the line opacities of the clumpy absorbers are highly sensitive to the flux changes. These findings provide a robust observational support for the ``hot inner and clumpy outer wind'' paradigm, suggesting a common origin for both the UFOs and the clumpy absorbers."}

Sampling from the distributions allows for a much improved description of event-to-event fluctuations, in amplitude and shape, along the shower axis. Including these effects is essential for a more accurate simulation of signal and background events in current and next-generation neutrino telescopes."}

Under review in A&A", "summary": "IceCube observations point to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) as promising contributors to the observed astrophysical neutrino flux. Close to the central black hole, protons can be accelerated through magnetic reconnection to very high energies and subsequently interact with abundant X-ray photons in the source, leading to neutrino production. We investigate whether the diffuse neutrino flux observed by IceCube can originate, via proton acceleration, in reconnection-powered coronae of non-jetted AGN. We create a library of neutrino spectral templates, over a large grid of values for the three key model parameters: the proton plasma magnetization of the corona $σ_{\\rm p}$, the X-ray coronal luminosity, and the black hole mass. Synchrotron cooling of pions and muons plays a significant role due to the large coronal magnetic fields. We couple the single-source model with a mock AGN catalog, consistent with the observed X-ray and mid-infrared AGN samples at redshifts $z=0-4$, to infer the diffuse neutrino flux. Coronal emission satisfactorily explains the most recent IceCube measurements of the diffuse neutrino flux up to energies of $\\sim 1$~PeV, provided that $\\sim$10\\% of the AGN coronae have $σ_{\\rm p} \\sim 10^5$, while the rest are distributed over a range of lower magnetizations.

We identified 21 such objects by crossmatching a ULX catalog with the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) and Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). They may have a diverse population. (i) Three have a double lobed radio structure with a compact core found in two of them, and could be quasars. (ii) Five are associated with extended radio structure and star forming regions in optical, where the radio emission is likely due to star forming activities, although the steep radio spectrum up to several GHz casts doubt on that. Two of them show X-ray variability suggesting that they are ULXs embedded in star forming regions. (iii) Thirteen are associated with an unresolved radio source, with a steep spectrum seen in eight, a flat or inverted spectrum seen in two. Those with a steep spectrum are arguably candidates for SS 433/W50 like objects, with radio emission due to optically thin synchrotron radiation in a surrounding jet/wind powered nebula. Remarkable cases include NGC 925 ULX1 and NGC 6946 ULX1, which are associated with an optical nebula. Those with a flat or inverted spectrum could be accreting black holes with a compact jet, while the black hole mass is estimated to be several $10^6 - 10^8$ $M_\\odot$ based on the fundamental plane.

This marks the first detection of GPs from a transitional MSP and adds to the small number of millisecond pulsars known to exhibit such extreme variability. A total of 235 GPs were detected across observations at 550-750 MHz, with widths as narrow as $1.28~μs$ and flux densities up to $\\sim 10^4$ times the pulsar's mean flux density. The GPs are strongly localized in pulse phase, originating predominantly from the second and third main-pulse components, and are absent in the inter-pulse region. The arrival times of the GPs deviate significantly from Poisson statistics, with the waiting-time distribution well described by a Weibull model having a shape parameter of $k = 0.30$, indicative of strong temporal clustering. During an epoch of enhanced activity, the GP rate increased by nearly two orders of magnitude to $124~\\mathrm{hr}^{-1}$, with a corresponding shape parameter of $k = 0.47$. This value is similar to that reported for a burst storm from the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20200120E, suggesting possible phenomenological parallels between GPs from compact binary systems and repeating FRBs."}

In this work, we compile a sample of 124 GRBs with known redshifts and simultaneous X-ray and optical afterglow observations. We categorize them into four subsets based on the existence of plateaus and the bands in which they appear. Namely, Dataset 1: plateaus are detected simultaneously in both X-ray and optical bands (75 bursts); Dataset 2: plateaus are only in X-rays (15 bursts); Dataset 3: plateaus appear only in the optical (17 bursts); Dataset 4: no plateaus in either band (17 bursts). We employ these datasets to test the applicability of the energy-injection model by examining whether the temporal decay index $α$ and the spectral index $β$ of GRB afterglows simultaneously satisfy the closure relations in X-ray and optical bands. We find that 47 bursts of Dataset 1 simultaneously obey the closure relations in both bands under the conditions of the electron spectral index $p>2$ and the injection parameter $q\\in (0, 0.5)$, and 69 of the dataset for $p>1$ and $q\\in (0, 0.8)$, providing a strong support for the energy-injection interpretation. However, for Datasets 2 and 3, although $α$ and $β$ of the plateaus mostly satisfy the closure relations, those in the other band show significant deviations, which implies that bursts with a single-band plateau are inconsistent with the interpretation of energy injection. Furthermore, we also compare the isotropic X-ray energy of plateaus with the rotational energy budget of millisecond magnetars."}

We measure the hard X-ray polarization angle and find it to be consistent with the previously measured position angle of the radio jet. Leveraging NuSTAR's detection of both the relativistic Fe K emission line and the Compton hump, we constrain the flux contribution of the reflected emission from the inner accretion disk to be 10% of the total X-ray flux in the IXPE energy band. Unlike previous studies that modeled only the Fe K emission line, we fit the full-band reflection spectrum using a fully relativistic disk model. There is strong degeneracy between the Comptonized and reflection components. Given that the Comptonized component is not expected to be highly polarized, a polarization degree of approximately 20% for the reflection component could explain the X-ray polarization data from IXPE. We also discuss the disk inclination angle inferred from our spectro-polarimetric modeling, as well as other possible explanations for the data."}

The ergostar hypothesis, that a rapidly rotating star with an ergoregion drives the relativistic jet, offers an alternative explanation to the black hole-accretion disk paradigm. However, previous studies based on conventional neutron star equations of state (EOSs) have shown that dynamically stable ergostars do not exist unless very extreme EOS or rotation are adopted, casting significant doubt on their astrophysical viability in reality. In this work, however, we examine this hypothesis using a phenomenological EOS of strangeon matter, i.e., condensed matter with nucleon-like units for three flavors of quarks. By constructing a large suite of uniformly rotating equilibrium models, we systematically investigate the parameter space of the stable ergostars and calculate their maximum extractable energy. In contrast to the case of conventional EOSs, we demonstrate that strangeon matter supports a vast and robust parameter space for dynamically stable ergostars, even without requiring differential rotation. We find that the extractable rotational energy from these configurations can be on the order of $0.01 M_\\odot$, a reservoir sufficient to power a typical sGRB. Our results revitalize the ergostar as a viable central engine for sGRB, suggesting that BNS merger remnants composed of exotic matter could play a crucial, previously underestimated role in high-energy astrophysics."}

This suggests that neutrinos are produced via hadronic interactions in a region opaque to gamma-rays, likely a hot corona surrounding the central supermassive black hole. However, the mechanism responsible for accelerating the parent protons to the required energies ($\\sim 100$ TeV) remains an open question. In this study, we investigate diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in active galactic nucleus (AGN) coronae using a suite of one-dimensional Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations spanning a broad range of plasma parameters. We find that DSA is a robust and efficient mechanism for proton acceleration, consistently channeling approximately 10\\% of the shock's kinetic energy into non-thermal ions, even for shocks with sonic Mach number as low as $ M_s \\approx 2$. In contrast, the efficiency of electron acceleration is highly variable and less efficient ($<1\\%$) in our parameter survey.

Studies of accretion-disc outflows across all mass scales, including accreting white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, and active galactic nuclei, have shown that winds play a key role in regulating both the accretion flow and the surrounding environment. Disc winds therefore provide a common thread linking a broad range of scientific topics, from the microphysics of accretion to galaxy-scale feedback and evolution, as well as binary evolution and the predicted rates of energetic (multi-messenger) transient phenomena. Yet we still lack a comprehensive picture of the accretion-feedback process. Optical spectroscopy has revealed striking similarities across mass scales, hinting at common production mechanisms, and has shown that winds can evolve on timescales of only minutes. Progress, however, has been limited by their transient nature, sparse time coverage, and the lack of simultaneous, high-resolution spectroscopy. Time-domain facilities with high temporal and spectral resolution will allow us to track these events in high accretion-rate systems, constrain their launching mechanisms, and measure the mass, energy, and angular momentum they carry. This will provide crucial input for binary evolution models, wind feedback, and a unified view of accreting systems across mass scales."}

The recently observed Tayler-Spruit dynamo has been invoked to explain angular momentum transport in stellar radiative zones and magnetar formation in a proto-neutron star spun-up by fallback accretion. Whether this dynamo mechanism can lead to different dynamical regimes remains an open question. Using three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, we model the dynamics of a stably stratified spherical Couette flow, with the outer sphere rotating faster than the inner one. While the generation of strong stationary and hemispherical dynamos has been observed in our previous studies, we report for the first time the existence of reversals and complex temporal dynamics. We observe that the dynamics is strongly correlated with the equatorial symmetry breaking of the flow. Focusing on a fiducial dynamo simulation, we propose a simple interpretation of its dynamics, which consists in the coupling of two large-scale magnetic modes with two opposite equatorial symmetries by the flow symmetry breaking. While this interpretation captures the simplest observed dynamics, the nonlinear interaction between a higher number of magnetic modes is certainly required to describe some of the more complex regimes. The wide diversity of dynamical regimes generated by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo may have interesting implications for the geometry of the neutron star magnetic fields, and therefore neutron star emissions."}

A lot of recent studies have focused on the observables associated with near merger binary black-holes (BBHs) embedded in a circumbinary disk (CBD) but we still we lack knowledge of observables of BBHs in their early stage. In that stage the separation between the two black holes is so large that both black holes could potentially retain their individual accretion disk existing before the creation of the BBH. For such early BBH systems, it is interesting to look for observables originating in those individual disks whose structure is likely to differ from mini-disks often observed in simulations of later stages of BBHs.\n  Aims. In a companion paper we presented a set of hydrodynamical simulations of an individual disk surrounding a primary black hole while being impacted by the presence of a secondary black-hole in an early BBH system, leading to the creation of three well-known characteristic features in the disk's structure. Here we explore the imprints of these three features on the observables associated with the thermal emission of the pre-existing black hole disk. The aim is two-fold, first to see which observables are best suited for detecting those early systems and, secondly, what could be extrapolated about these systems from observations.\n  Methods. We used general relativistic ray-tracing in order to produce synthetic observations of the thermal emission emitted by early BBHs with different mass ratio and separations in order to search for distinctive observational features of early systems.\n  Results. We found that in the case of early BBH with pre-existing disk(s) a necessary, although not unique, observational feature is the truncation of their disk(s).\n  Conclusions. Such observable could be used for automated search of potential BBHs and discriminate some existing candidates."}

We present a convolutional neural network framework designed for real-time detection and multi-mode frequency extraction of post-merger signals, achieving an inference latency of 3.0 ms and a frequency accuracy of 48.6 Hz on the direct-comparison subsets (53 Hz on the comprehensive test set). The framework is validated on realistic LIGO O4 detector noise including authentic GravitySpy glitch morphologies, demonstrating ROC AUC of 0.999999 and 99.998% detection efficiency at 1% false alarm rate. These exceptional performance metrics arise from an aggressive training augmentation strategy that exposes the network to artificially challenging conditions, enabling robust generalization to our synthetic O4 detector noise model. We compare performance against a simplified matched filtering baseline using Lorentzian templates (23x more accurate despite a 4.7x computational overhead) and Bayesian parameter estimation (1.2 million times faster), establishing complementary trade-offs in the analysis landscape. While current O4 sensitivity limits post-merger detections to ~20 Mpc (~1 detection per century), this methodology provides essential infrastructure for third-generation detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer) where post-merger detection will become routine with annual detection rates exceeding 100 events. Our validation framework identifies expected behavior in uncertainty scaling that reflects realistic training constraints rather than idealized Fisher information limits, demonstrating honest assessment practices for machine learning applications in gravitational wave astronomy."}
