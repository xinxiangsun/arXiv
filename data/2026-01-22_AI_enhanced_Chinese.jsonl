The kilonova signal was extensively studied in the spectral and time domains, giving key insights into the chemical composition and physical properties of the ejecta. Here, we report the discovery of a novel correlation between two fundamental observables: the peak energy of the EF_E spectrum, Ep, and the isotropic-equivalent luminosity, Liso. In particular, we show that up to about 2.5 days after the merger, the AT2017gfo spectrum evolves according to: log10[Ep/eV] = -0.13 (+0.02/-0.02) + 0.62 (+0.02/-0.02) * log10[Liso/(1e41 erg/s)] (68% C.L.) while in subsequent epochs, Ep remains almost constant with Liso, flattening around 1 eV. Exploiting simulations from a state-of-the-art radiative transfer code, we demonstrate that our kilonova model inherently predicts this peculiar correlation, suggesting a new diagnostic tool for comparing observables against simulations. Future kilonova observations will provide additional insight into the physics behind the Ep-Liso correlation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728AT2017gfo\u5343\u65b0\u661f\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5cf0\u503c\u80fd\u91cfEp\u4e0e\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u5149\u5ea6Liso\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65b0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1a\u524d2.5\u5929\u5448\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e4b\u540eEp\u7a33\u5b9a\u57281eV\u5de6\u53f3", "motivation": "AT2017gfo\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u591a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u5343\u65b0\u661f\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76r\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6838\u5408\u6210\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u673a\u4f1a\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5176\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8fde\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790AT2017gfo\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Ep\u4e0eLiso\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u524d2.5\u5929\u5b58\u5728\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\uff1alog10[Ep/eV] = -0.13 + 0.62 * log10[Liso/(1e41 erg/s)]\uff0c\u4e4b\u540eEp\u7a33\u5b9a\u57281eV\u5de6\u53f3\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8be5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u662f\u5343\u65b0\u661f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "Ep-Liso\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e3a\u6bd4\u8f83\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5343\u65b0\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u8be5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

We detect ($>5\u03c3$) both bubble tips in both radio and $\u03b3$-rays, and find a radio spectrum corresponding to high, Mach $3$-$5$ shocks. The southern bubble is fainter, by $\\sim$an order of magnitude in radio, its edge propagating into a medium roughly half as dense.

Recent progress in this field by Einstein Probe has found that many FXTs are associated with gamma-ray bursts and the collapse of massive stars. Motivated by this, we searched the NuSTAR archive in the harder 3--79 keV band for $\\sim1000$ s duration transients. From 204 Ms of exposure we present five candidate FXTs, four of which are spectrally hard, with power-law indices $-3<\u0393<0$, standing them apart from FXTs discovered in the soft band. Three have potential associations with galaxies at $z=0.1-2$, implying 3--79 keV luminosities of $10^{43}$ to $10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and volumetric event rates of 125--2900 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$.

However, thermal conduction can be strongly enhanced when materials of significantly different temperature are brought into proximity, and thus into close thermal contact. Jets of active galactic nuclei may act as heat pumps by bringing low-entropy gas from the cluster core into thermal contact with the hot outer atmosphere of the cluster, significantly increasing the feedback efficiency of active galactic nuclei. We test this hypothesis by running a suite of 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of active galactic nuclei jets in a Perseus-like cluster, including anisotropic conduction. We find that the heat pump efficiency $\u03b7$ can reach up to 50\\% of the maximum possible efficiency $\u03b7_{\\rm max}$ if conduction operates near the Spitzer-Braginskii limit, while $\u03b7\\approx f_{\\rm sp}\u03b7_{\\rm max}$ if conduction along the field lines is substantially suppressed below the Spitzer-Braginskii value by a factor $f_{\\rm sp}$ by kinetic effects, as recently suggested. We further find that jet-induced thermal conduction is self-limiting: Magnetic draping during the uplift results in a magnetic field orientation close to perpendicular to the induced temperature gradients, significantly reducing conduction along the ideal conductive pathways. Thus, for conservative assumptions about thermal conduction suppression by $f_{\\rm sp} \\lesssim 0.1$, the heat pump effect leads to only marginal heat transfer and, correspondingly, to immaterial changes in the overall thermal evolution of cool core clusters beyond the isolated effects of conduction and jet-induced heating alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc73D\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u6d4b\u8bd5AGN\u55b7\u6d41\u4f5c\u4e3a\u70ed\u6cf5\u7684\u5047\u8bf4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u6548\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe\u6700\u5927\u503c\u768450%\uff0c\u4f46\u78c1\u529b\u62d6\u66f3\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u4f20\u5bfc\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u51b7\u6838\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u6574\u4f53\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u7406\u8bba\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u91ca\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u51b7\u5374\u6d41\u4e2d\u65ad\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46AGN\u55b7\u6d41\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f4e\u6e29\u6c14\u4f53\u5e26\u5230\u9ad8\u6e29\u533a\u57df\u5f62\u6210\u70ed\u6cf5\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u53cd\u9988\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u76843D\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u82f1\u4ed9\u5ea7\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6a21\u62dfAGN\u55b7\u6d41\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u70ed\u6cf5\u5047\u8bf4\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u63a5\u8fd1Spitzer-Braginskii\u6781\u9650\u65f6\uff0c\u70ed\u6cf5\u6548\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe\u6700\u5927\u503c\u768450%\uff1b\u4f46\u55b7\u6d41\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u78c1\u529b\u62d6\u66f3\u6548\u5e94\u4f7f\u78c1\u573a\u65b9\u5411\u4e0e\u6e29\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u5782\u76f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u4f20\u5bfc\uff1b\u5f53\u4f20\u5bfc\u88ab\u6291\u5236\u5230Spitzer-Braginskii\u503c\u768410%\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65f6\uff0c\u70ed\u6cf5\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u51b7\u6838\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "AGN\u55b7\u6d41\u4f5c\u4e3a\u70ed\u6cf5\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u78c1\u529b\u62d6\u66f3\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u51b7\u5374\u6d41\u4e2d\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002"}}

Traditionally, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used as a flexible machine learning method to mitigate non-Gaussian noise. However, training CNNs requires many data samples, especially when the input data segments are long. Glitches that mimic high-mass black hole signals are empirically known to have a wavelet-like structure. We exploit this property in $\\texttt{WaveletNet}$ by using simple neural networks to learn the best family of wavelets to model glitches in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 data. Due to its simplicity, our framework is significantly more sample-efficient than CNNs. As a use case, we build upon the $\\texttt{TIER}$ method and show how $\\texttt{WaveletNet}$ can improve the performance of any search pipeline. We take potential GW candidates from the pipeline, and then downweight the candidates having noisy strain regions in their vicinity. We use our framework in a modular way: we provide an output score which can be added to the pipeline's existing detection statistic score for the candidates.

Here we analyse all XMM-Newton MOS and pn and Chandra ACIS-S spectra of the Vela Junior CCO, with observations taking place over the 9 years from 2001 to 2010. We find that the best-fit flux and spectral model parameters do not vary significantly when treating each observation independently, and therefore we fit all the spectra simultaneously using various spectral models to characterize the predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our results indicate the Vela Junior CCO has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, a hot spot temperature (unredshifted) of 3.5x10^6 K, and a colder surface temperature of (6.6-8.8)x10^5 K. Possible absorption lines at ~0.6 keV and 0.9 keV provide evidence for the first-time of an average surface magnetic field B~3x10^10 G for this CCO, which is similar to the magnetic field of other CCOs. At the accurate new Vela Junior distance of 1.4 kpc, the observed luminosity that is dominated by the hot spot is ~5x10^32 erg s^-1. The luminosity from the rest of the colder surface is (1.3-4.0)x10^32 erg s^-1.

While these meetings are essential for interacting with other researchers and establishing collaborations, many remain only accessible to those with substantial travel funding, flexible schedules, or geographical proximity. This introduces barriers that predominantly affect early career researchers (ECRs) and people from under-resourced regions, limiting the growth, diversity, and sustainability of the community. To address these issues, the FRB 2025 conference, held in Montr\u00e9al in July 2025 with over 200 participants, was designed to prioritize inclusivity and accessibility alongside scientific excellence. In this work, we describe how we implemented these goals, including: organizing committees spearheaded by ECRs, a fully hybrid format including YouTube livestreams, low registration fees, a pedagogical day at the beginning of the conference, local vegetarian catering, and the implementation of flash-talks instead of posters. From a post-conference survey of participants, we were able to assess the effectiveness of our initiatives. Notably, we received very positive feedback from the online participants, which amounted to roughly half of the attendees, especially regarding the livestreams and talk recordings.

The low registration fees naturally led to challenges, in particular with the audio-visual management, and although areas for improvement were noted, such as poster sessions and support for attendees requiring visas, the conference was generally viewed as a success.

Subsequent photon-photon absorption between the incoming MeV $\u03b3$-rays and the back-scattered X-rays generate electron-positron pairs, enriching the surrounding medium with leptons. We investigate how these back-scattered photons modify the prompt GRB spectrum through $\u03b3-\u03b3$ absorption. In a dense and pair-loaded wind environment, the emerging spectra exhibit a broad attenuation structure, whose morphology is sensitive to the low-energy spectral index $\u03b1$. In particular, spectra with $\u03b1> -1$ develop a pronounced, saddle-shaped absorption between 1 and 100 MeV (rest frame). Such external MeV absorption could account for the spectral curvature seen in some bright GRBs, and may point to enhanced mass loss from their progenitor stars, consistent with early observations of core-collapse supernovae.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\u4e2dX\u5c04\u7ebf\u540e\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u5149\u5b50\u901a\u8fc7\u03b3-\u03b3\u5438\u6536\u5bf9\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\u80fd\u8c31\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bc6\u96c6\u5bf9\u52a0\u8f7d\u661f\u98ce\u73af\u5883\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f1-100 MeV\u7684\u978d\u5f62\u5438\u6536\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u67d0\u4e9b\u660e\u4eae\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\u7684\u80fd\u8c31\u5f2f\u66f2\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\u4e2d\u9003\u9038\u51fa\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u55b7\u6d41\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u5b50\u88ab\u5468\u56f4\u4ecb\u8d28\u7535\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u03b3-\u03b3\u5438\u6536\u4ea7\u751f\u7535\u5b50-\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u5bf9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u540e\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u5149\u5b50\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u03b3-\u03b3\u5438\u6536\u6539\u53d8\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u80fd\u8c31\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\u4e2dX\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u540e\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6563\u5c04\u5149\u5b50\u4e0e\u5165\u5c04MeV \u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5149\u5b50-\u5149\u5b50\u5438\u6536\u4ea7\u751f\u7535\u5b50-\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u5bf9\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u5bf9\u52a0\u8f7d\u661f\u98ce\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u80fd\u8c31\u8870\u51cf\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u5bf9\u52a0\u8f7d\u661f\u98ce\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u80fd\u8c31\u5448\u73b0\u5bbd\u6cdb\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u4f4e\u80fd\u8c31\u6307\u6570\u03b1\u654f\u611f\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u03b1 > -1\u65f6\uff0c\u57281-100 MeV\uff08\u9759\u6b62\u7cfb\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f62\u6210\u660e\u663e\u7684\u978d\u5f62\u5438\u6536\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u5916\u90e8MeV\u5438\u6536\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u67d0\u4e9b\u660e\u4eae\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u80fd\u8c31\u5f2f\u66f2\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6307\u5411\u5176\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u65e9\u671f\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

HWO will also be able to perform a host of other transformational astrophysics, including cosmology, galaxy evolution, solar system science, and beyond. The development of the telescope and instrument suite is an iterative process. Example observatory architectures, called exploratory analytic cases (EACs) by the HWO Technology Maturation Project Office (TMPO), are modeled end-to-end to explore the engineering and science trade space. Recently, an ultraviolet Integral Field Spectrograph (UV IFS) was added to HWO's instrument suite for the EACs 4 and 5. To explore the science and engineering trade space for this specific instrument, we developed a high-fidelity UV IFS simulation tool, PyISH. The UV IFS simulation tool is designed to be used by scientists to model specific science cases as seen by a UV IFS on HWO, as well as engineers to explore the trade space when developing potential instrument architectures.

Combining three-dimensional SPH simulations of a binary with analytical modeling, we characterize the event from initial encounter to terminal explosion. We demonstrate that grazing encounters induce tidal capture and rapid orbital decay, accompanied by large-amplitude, nonlinear stellar oscillations. The subsequent inspiral spins up the common envelope into a stable, non-spherical equilibrium, powering a luminous precursor with quasi-periodic bursts. The terminal explosion, modeled with angular momentum conservation, produces an intrinsically flattened remnant that preserves a geometric memory, or morphomnesia, of its binary origin. The associated gravitational wave signal features a rapid, drag-dominated frequency evolution, identifiable by a unique time-varying apparent chirp mass.

High quality, time- and energy-resolved linear polarization measurements of prompt $\u03b3$-ray photons can distinguish between synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes and provide crucial constraints on the outflow properties. This will be achieved by POLAR-2 that is proposed as a dedicated GRB polarimeter and successor to POLAR. The High-energy Polarimetry Detector (HPD) is one of the three instruments of POLAR-2 that features significantly improved sensitivity in the $(40-1000)$\\,keV energy range and a detection area four times larger than that of POLAR. Here we demonstrate the capabilities of the HPD to constrain key physical model parameters by creating and fitting to synthetic sources using a time-resolved spectro-polarimetric theoretical model of prompt GRB emission. The time-resolved spectral and polarization fits are performed using a novel technique featuring maximum likelihood over an unbinned (in time and energy) list of detected events. The constrained model parameters directly relate to the underlying source physics that would reveal an accelerating, coasting or decelerating emission region. For a pulse fluence of $\\mathcal{F}=10^{-5}\\mathcal{F}_{-5}\\,{\\rm erg\\,cm^{-2}}$ we can constrain the time-integrated polarization degree to an absolute accuracy ($1\\,\u03c3$) of about $2.5\\mathcal{F}_{-5}^{\\,-1/2}$ per cent, as long as source photons dominate over the background. In bright GRBs, such unprecedented accuracy at these energies will allow to distinguish between different models for the prompt GRB emission mechanism and constrain the magnetic field geometry, jet angular structure and outflow composition.", "AI": {"tldr": "POLAR-2\u7684HPD\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7684\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\u77ac\u65f6\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u504f\u632f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u533a\u5206\u8f90\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u548c\u9650\u5236\u55b7\u6d41\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\u77ac\u65f6\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u504f\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u9006\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u55b7\u6d41\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528POLAR-2\u7684\u9ad8\u80fd\u504f\u632f\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668(HPD)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7684\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6e90\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u65e0\u65f6\u95f4\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u7bb1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5217\u8868\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8109\u51b2\u6d41\u91cf\u4e3a10\u207b\u2075 erg cm\u207b\u00b2\u7684\u6e90\uff0c\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u4e3b\u5bfc\u80cc\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u504f\u632f\u5ea6\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53ef\u8fbe\u7ea62.5% (1\u03c3)\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u8f90\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u78c1\u573a\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u55b7\u6d41\u89d2\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6d41\u51fa\u6210\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "POLAR-2\u7684HPD\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5c06\u4ee5\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\u504f\u632f\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u77ac\u65f6\u8f90\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u548c\u55b7\u6d41\u7269\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

Code can be downloaded at https://bitbucket.org/fittingtransientswithdiscs/fitted_public/src/main/", "summary": "Tidal disruption events (TDEs) represent a truly unique, and potentially very powerful, probe of the quiescent supermassive black hole (SMBH) population. Given current observational survey capabilities the vast majority of the TDEs discovered in the next decade will be observed only across optical-UV wavelengths. A set of questions of broad scientific interest relating to SMBH demographics and SMBH-galaxy correlations could in principal be answered by using TDE emission as an efficient means to constrain SMBH masses. In this paper we argue for using well-understood elements of TDE emission (the thermal X-ray continuum and late-time UV plateau) to derive empirical relationships between the more poorly understood early optical/UV flare and the black hole mass, before using these empirical relationships to measure TDE black hole masses simply and rapidly. We provide a publicly available code TDEFLARE which does this, showing (i) it produces results consistent with disk codes containing far more physics, (ii) it reproduces galactic scaling relationships at high ($>5\u03c3$) significance, (iii) it produces reliable mass estimates for both partial and full disruptions, and (iv) it does not require late time data to derive mass constraints. We provide 89 TDE black hole mass constraints, derive the intrinsic black hole mass function implied by the current TDE population, and discuss the Malmquist-Hills bias, an important confounding factor in TDE science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528TDE\u65e9\u671f\u5149\u5b66/\u7d2b\u5916\u8000\u53d1\u4e0e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u516c\u5f00\u4ee3\u7801TDEFLARE\u5feb\u901f\u6d4b\u91cfTDE\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e8689\u4e2aTDE\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6f6e\u6c50\u74e6\u89e3\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08TDEs\uff09\u662f\u63a2\u6d4b\u9759\u6b62\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff08SMBH\uff09\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u89c2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u4e8e\u5149\u5b66-\u7d2b\u5916\u6ce2\u6bb5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u65e9\u671f\u5149\u5b66/\u7d2b\u5916\u8000\u53d1\u5feb\u901f\u6d4b\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76SMBH\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e-\u661f\u7cfb\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528TDE\u53d1\u5c04\u4e2d\u7406\u89e3\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u70edX\u5c04\u7ebf\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u548c\u665a\u671f\u7d2b\u5916\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u65e9\u671f\u5149\u5b66/\u7d2b\u5916\u8000\u53d1\u4e0e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u516c\u5f00\u4ee3\u7801TDEFLARE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5173\u7cfb\u5feb\u901f\u6d4b\u91cfTDE\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u665a\u671f\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "TDEFLARE\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a1\uff09\u4e0e\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u591a\u7269\u7406\u7684\u76d8\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b2\uff09\u9ad8\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff08>5\u03c3\uff09\u590d\u73b0\u661f\u7cfb\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b3\uff09\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u74e6\u89e3\u90fd\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u9760\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b4\uff09\u65e0\u9700\u665a\u671f\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u8d28\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e8689\u4e2aTDE\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5f53\u524dTDE\u7fa4\u4f53\u9690\u542b\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5229\u7528TDE\u5feb\u901f\u6d4b\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76SMBH\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610fMalmquist-Hills\u504f\u5dee\u8fd9\u4e00TDE\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

In the failed-supernova scenario, most of the yellow supergiant collapsed to form a black hole. Due to the energy carried by neutrinos from the cooling, collapsing core, gravity decreases, leading to the ejection of a small fraction of the outer envelope, some of which remains bound. The fallback accreted gas possesses large angular-momentum fluctuations due to the pre-collapse envelope convection. The fallback material forms intermittent accretion disks around the black hole that launch jets (or disk wind), which unbind most of the bound material. The failed-supernova scenario for M31-2014-DS1 requires that only <1% of the bound material be accreted by the black hole, but the jets do not shut down the backflow for over 10 years. I find this fine-tuned requirement unlikely. I also find that, due to the rapid radiative cooling of the outflow interaction zone with the outer gas, the expected radiation is about an order of magnitude or more above the observed value. These, as well as earlier challenges raised against the failed-supernova scenario, make the alternative type II intermediate-luminosity optical transient scenario, in which fading is due to dust ejection in a violent binary interaction, more likely.

Within 15 pc of the Solar System ($\\sim 50$ ly), there may be a few black holes. If located inside one of the Local Interstellar Clouds - which occupy 5-20% of this local volume - an isolated black hole could produce detectable electromagnetic emission via accretion from the interstellar medium, given the capabilities of current or near-future observatories. However, precise predictions remain challenging due to large uncertainties in the expected accretion spectra. Outside these clouds, the accretion rate would be too low in any standard model to yield a detectable electromagnetic signal. While astrometric detection via gravitational perturbation of nearby stars is conceivable, the local stellar density is too low for this method to be realistically successful. We have searched the Gaia DR3 catalog for candidate isolated black holes accreting from the interstellar medium and identified five sources.

In contrast, IGR J17091-3624 is less obscured, making it a more accessible target for optical investigations. Due to its weak radio emission, optical and infrared data are essential to probe the jet and outer disc behavior of IGR J17091-3624. This study presents the first long-term optical monitoring of IGR J17091-3624, using data from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) over its 2011, 2016, and 2022 outbursts. We combine these observations with quasi-simultaneous X-ray data from Swift/XRT, RXTE, and NICER, employing light curve and variability analysis, spectral energy distributions, color-magnitude diagrams, and optical/X-ray correlations to investigate optical emission mechanisms. We find that the optical and X-ray fluxes are significantly correlated, following a power-law relation with the index 0.40\\pm0.04, suggesting that the optical emission in IGR J17091-3624 is dominated by an X-ray-irradiated accretion disk. Based on optical spectral slope constraints, we estimate the extinction toward IGR J17091-3624 A_V = 4.3 to 6.6 mag. The global optical/X-ray correlation suggests a distance estimate of 8-17 kpc, in line with previous findings.

Their existence could be probed through their conversions into photons in the presence of magnetic fields. In this work, we explore the effect of these photon-ALP conversions by searching for an attenuation in the observed gamma ray spectra of galactic sources that emit at energies of hundreds of TeV. We analyze data from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory for the source 3HWC J1908+063. No evidence of photon-ALP conversions was found, and we set constraints on the ALP parameter space.

Hughes"], "title": "Evidence of mutually exclusive outflow forms from a black hole X-ray binary", "comment": null, "summary": "Accretion onto black holes often leads to the launch of outflows that significantly influence their surrounding environments. The two primary forms of these outflows are X-ray disk winds-hot, ionized gases ejected from the accretion disk-and relativistic jets, which are collimated streams of particles often expelled along the rotational axis of the black hole. While previous studies have revealed a general association between spectral states and different types of outflows, the physical mechanisms governing wind and jet formation remain debated. Here, using coordinated NICER and MeerKAT observations of the recurrent black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-472, we identify a clear anti-correlation between X-ray disk winds and jets: during three recent outbursts, only one type of outflow is detected at a time. Notably, this apparent exclusivity occurs even as the overall accretion luminosity remains within the range expected for a standard thin disk, characteristic of the canonical soft state. These results suggest a competition between outflow channels that may depend on how the accretion energy is partitioned between the disk and the corona.

Located near its center is the gamma-ray binary 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856, although the physical association between the two systems is not clear yet. Our X-ray spectroscopy with Suzaku reveals that G284.3$-$1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856 have compatible absorption column densities of $N_\\mathrm{H} = 6\\textrm{--}7 \\times 10^{21}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, indicating that the two systems have similar distances. The actual distance is determined as $3~\\mathrm{kpc}$ using $\\mathrm{^{12}CO}$ ($J=1\\textrm{--}0$) data obtained with NANTEN. The X-ray spectrum of G284.3$-$1.8 shows a strong K-shell emission line of Mg, confirming that the earlier claim that the SNR is one of the few Mg-rich SNRs. Comparing recent stellar models taking into account the \"shell merger\" processes, we find that the obtained Mg-to-Ne mass ratio of $M_\\mathrm{Mg}/M_\\mathrm{Ne} = 0.73^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ and Si-to-Mg mass ratio of $M_\\mathrm{Si}/M_\\mathrm{Mg} = 0.44\\pm0.03$ suggest a supernova explosion that would have left a neutron star. The characteristics of 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856, on the other hand, are better explained with a model in which its compact object is neutron star.

SN~2023zcu exhibits a well-sampled light curve covering the rise, plateau, and nebular phases. It has an optically thick phase of $100.6 \\pm 0.6$ d with a magnitude drop of $\\sim$1.7 mag in the {\\em V} band during the transition between the plateau and the nebular phases. Weak emission features in the early-time spectra indicate a low-level interaction between circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta. The spectral evolution is well sampled and exhibits a prominent P-Cygni profile of H$\u03b1$, a defining characteristic of Type IIP SNe. Signatures of metal-line formation (e.g., \\ion{Fe}{2}, \\ion{Ca}{2} near-infrared triplet) are also evident in the spectra as the SN evolves. Spectral modeling with the radiative-transfer code \\texttt{TARDIS} during the early photospheric phase (8.7--35.5 d since explosion) yields photospheric temperatures decreasing from $\\sim$9,000 to $\\sim$6,000 K and expansion velocities declining from $\\sim$10,000 to $\\sim$5,400 km s$^{-1}$. A tailored expanding photosphere method (EPM) fit based on the \\texttt{TARDIS} models provides a distance estimate of $27.8 \\pm 2.0$ Mpc.

To isolate this effect, we adopt the standard disk-corona configuration but disable the corona, allowing the reflection spectrum to be produced solely by self-irradiation of the disk.

We perform parameter-space surveys and mock parameter inferences assuming the nominal sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope (ET) to identify the regime where the time-varying LOSA allows for separate constraints on the outer orbital parameters, in particular the tertiary mass and distance. We estimate that ET may detect a few to tens of such systems per year, provided that all binaries merge dynamically, and demonstrate that these constraints can be used to directly discriminate between a dynamical and AGN origin for BBHs.

Applying the Bayesian block algorithm to the 3-day binned $\u03b3$-ray lightcurve, we identify pronounced variability, including four major outbursts marked by significant flux enhancements. The highest flux recorded was $(1.1 \\pm 0.2)\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{ph}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ on 57868.5 MJD. Each outburst comprises multiple components, and lightcurve profile analysis indicates predominantly symmetric temporal structures. The shortest variability timescale of 4.5 hours constrains the emission region to be located within 0.03 pc of the central engine, likely near the broad-line region (BLR). Additionally, two highest-energy photons were detected with energies of 46.4 GeV (on 57739.6 MJD) and 42.5 GeV (on 59161.9 MJD), observed outside the peak flaring activity. The fractional variability shows an overall increasing trend from UV/optical to $\u03b3$-ray bands, with a noticeable dip in the X-ray range, consistent with the shape of the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). The flux distributions during flares exhibit log-normal or double log-normal behavior, suggesting multiplicative variability processes and evolving emission zones. Cross-correlation analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the $\u03b3$-ray and X-ray bands, with X-rays lagging by 42.5 days. Broadband SED modeling across different flux states supports a one-zone leptonic scenario, with $\u03b3$-ray emission produced via external Compton scattering of IR and BLR photons. High-flux states show harder electron spectra, elevated break energies, and reduced magnetic fields-features consistent with efficient particle acceleration and Compton dominance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u8000\u53d8\u4f53S5 1044+71\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u7206\u53d1\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u6700\u77ed\u53d8\u65f6\u68074.5\u5c0f\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u53d1\u5c04\u533a\u4f4d\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f15\u64ce0.03 pc\u5185\uff0cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6ede\u540e\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf42.5\u5929\uff0c\u5bbd\u5e26SED\u7b26\u5408\u5355\u533a\u8f7b\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8000\u53d8\u4f53S5 1044+71\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u65f6\u53d8\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u3001\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u6ce2\u6bb5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Fermi-LAT\u548cSwift-XRT/UVOT\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5757\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u6807\u5206\u6790\u3001\u80fd\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5bbd\u5e26SED\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u6b21\u4e3b\u8981\u7206\u53d1\uff0c\u6700\u77ed\u53d8\u65f6\u68074.5\u5c0f\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u53d1\u5c04\u533a\u4f4d\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f15\u64ce0.03 pc\u5185\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u9ad8\u80fd\u5149\u5b50(46.4 GeV\u548c42.5 GeV)\uff1bX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6ede\u540e\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf42.5\u5929\uff1b\u53d8\u7387\u4eceUV/\u5149\u5b66\u5230\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u9012\u589e\uff0cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff1bSED\u5efa\u6a21\u652f\u6301\u5355\u533a\u8f7b\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9ad8\u6d41\u91cf\u6001\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u786c\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8c31\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u3002", "conclusion": "S5 1044+71\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u652f\u6301\u53d1\u5c04\u533a\u4f4d\u4e8eBLR\u9644\u8fd1\uff0c\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u901a\u8fc7IR\u548cBLR\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u6563\u5c04\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u9ad8\u6d41\u91cf\u6001\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6d3b\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u6f14\u5316\u3002"}}

Accepted for publication in Astrophysics and Space Sciences", "summary": "The Gaia Alerts system is providing alerts on a variety of objects displaying a significant photometric change detected by the Gaia satellite from one passage to the next one over the same region of the sky. Among the over 22000 alerts published until the end of 2022, around 13 percent concern AGN or quasar candidates. We have embarked on a spectroscopic ground-based follow-up of some of those (including some selected by a different method specifically in galactic nuclei), to establish their true nature, and reveal the various phenomena leading to a change in magnitude of those AGN. The present paper deals with radio-quiet objects, while the radio-loud ones will be described in a companion paper. We confirm, on one hand, the AGN/quasar nature of 64 new candidates alerted by Gaia, and, on the other hand, obtained second-epoch spectra of over 200 known AGN also alerted for large photometric variations. The observed phenomena show a large variety: from Flares to Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) and a large number of Changing Look Quasars (CLQs, 56 secure ones, plus 23 probable ones), not forgetting some rarer events like SNe, microlensing events or Extreme Coronal Line Emitters. This sample shows that variability is an excellent tool to detect new quasars, especially radio-quiet ones that otherwise would be undetected, and that a significant fraction of variable AGN/quasars, around 10 percent, presents the CLQ phenomenon. Some of the new CLQs are followed-up to monitor further changes and measure time scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "Gaia\u536b\u661f\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u5927\u91cf\u5929\u4f53\u53d8\u5316\u8b66\u62a5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d13%\u4e3aAGN/\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u5176\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u5c04\u7535\u5b81\u9759\u5929\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e8664\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684AGN/\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9200\u591a\u4e2a\u5df2\u77e5AGN\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u6b21\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8000\u53d1\u3001\u6f6e\u6c50\u74e6\u89e3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u53d8\u8138\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "Gaia\u8b66\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5df2\u53d1\u5e03\u8d85\u8fc722000\u4e2a\u5149\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u8b66\u62a5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7ea613%\u4e3aAGN/\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u8ba4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u8d28\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5bfc\u81f4AGN\u5149\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u5730\u9762\u5149\u8c31\u540e\u7eed\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9Gaia\u8b66\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5c04\u7535\u5b81\u9759AGN/\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u5730\u9762\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u786e\u8ba464\u4e2a\u65b0\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u7684AGN/\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u6027\u8d28\uff1b2) \u5bf9200\u591a\u4e2a\u5df2\u77e5AGN\u8fdb\u884c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\uff1b3) \u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u53d8\u8138\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u4ee5\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "1) \u786e\u8ba4\u4e8664\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684AGN/\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\uff1b2) \u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u8000\u53d1\u3001\u6f6e\u6c50\u74e6\u89e3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u300156\u4e2a\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u53d8\u8138\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53+23\u4e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u53d8\u8138\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u3001\u5fae\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7b49\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff1b3) \u53d1\u73b0\u7ea610%\u7684\u53ef\u53d8AGN/\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53d8\u8138\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b4) \u8bc1\u660e\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u662f\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b0\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5c04\u7535\u5b81\u9759\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5149\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u662f\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b0\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5c04\u7535\u5b81\u9759\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ea610%\u7684\u53ef\u53d8AGN/\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53d8\u8138\u73b0\u8c61\u3002Gaia\u8b66\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76AGN\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8000\u53d1\u3001\u6f6e\u6c50\u74e6\u89e3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u53d8\u8138\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u7b49\u3002"}}

We compute a suite of time-dependent, three-dimensional GRMHD simulations of collapsars in evolving spacetime. We update the Kerr metric components due to the growth of the black hole mass and changes its angular momentum. The self-gravity is considered via perturbative terms. We present for the first time the process of jet formation in self-gravitating collapsars. We find that self-gravity leads to temporary jet quenching, which can explain some features in the gamma-ray burst prompt emission. We find no substantial difference in jet launching times between models with and without self-gravity. We observe that in the absence of self-gravity, the jet can extract more rotational energy from the black hole, while self-gravitating models produce narrower jet opening angles. We show that under certain conditions, self-gravity can interrupt the jet formation process, resulting in a failed burst. Our computations show that self-gravity significantly modifies the process of jet propagation, resulting in notably different jet properties. We show that the timescales, variability, and opening angle of jet depend on whether self-gravity is included or not. We argue that self-gravity can potentially explain certain prompt emission properties due to the jet quenching.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8003\u8651\u548c\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u574d\u7f29\u661f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u55b7\u6d41\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u55b7\u6d41\u6682\u65f6\u7184\u706d\u3001\u55b7\u6d41\u5f00\u89d2\u53d8\u7a84\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u66b4\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u5bf9\u574d\u7f29\u661f\u55b7\u6d41\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u76f8\u540c\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8003\u8651\u548c\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3001\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u7ef4\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08GRMHD\uff09\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u5bf9Kerr\u5ea6\u89c4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u6270\u9879\u8003\u8651\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u55b7\u6d41\u6682\u65f6\u7184\u706d\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u66b4\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a84\u7684\u55b7\u6d41\u5f00\u89d2\uff1b\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u65f6\u55b7\u6d41\u80fd\u4ece\u9ed1\u6d1e\u63d0\u53d6\u66f4\u591a\u8f6c\u52a8\u80fd\uff1b\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u4f1a\u4e2d\u65ad\u55b7\u6d41\u5f62\u6210\u5bfc\u81f4\u7206\u53d1\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u55b7\u6d41\u4f20\u64ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u574d\u7f29\u661f\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u5f00\u89d2\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u66b4\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u55b7\u6d41\u7184\u706d\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

These sources serve as ideal laboratories for studying particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in relativistic jets. In this work, we systematically analyze the $\\sim$16-year Fermi-LAT observational data for 25 extreme high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs). The results indicate that the majority of these sources display stable or low flux levels in the GeV band, with only 6 sources showing significant variability at a confidence level exceeding 5$\u03c3$. The time-averaged spectra over the 16-year period for most EHBLs are well described by a hard power-law model, with photon indices predominantly clustered between 1.7 and 1.8. Using Fermi-LAT data in conjunction with multiwavelength observations compiled from the literature, we construct broadband SEDs for these EHBLs and fit them with a one-zone synchrotron + synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. We find that this simplified theoretical framework is sufficient for modeling the observed SEDs of most of these EHBLs, albeit requiring relatively higher electron energies compared to other $\u03b3$-ray emitting HBLs, and at times under-representing the UV emission.

The collapsar and CEJSN r-process scenario might also contribute to the lighter r-process elements, and the binary neutron star (NS-NS) merger r-process scenario might contribute to the third r-process peak. The magnetar, the wind from the newly born NS, and the accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf r-process scenarios fall short in explaining observations. They might exist, but cannot be major contributors to the r-process in the early Universe. To constrain r-process scenarios in the early Universe, I require that they explain the large scatter in the r-process abundances of very metal-poor stars, account for the correlation between light r-process nucleosynthesis and iron production, and the lack of correlation between the third peak r-process production and iron production, as inferred from very metal-poor stars.

During the LISA mission, multiple EMRIs are expected to be detected, allowing statistical studies of massive black hole populations and their formation pathways. We perform hierarchical Bayesian inference on simulated EMRI catalogues to assess how well LISA could constrain the astrophysical population using parametrised population models. We test our inference framework on a variety of populations, including heterogeneous and homogeneous mixtures of parametrised subpopulations, and scenarios in which the assumed model is deliberately misspecified. Our results show that population parameters governing distributions with sharp features can be tightly constrained. Mixed populations can be disentangled with as few as $\\sim20$ detections, and even with model misspecification, the inference retains sensitivity to key population features. These results demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of EMRI population inference, providing guidance for constructing realistic astrophysical population models for LISA analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "LISA\u4efb\u52a1\u5c06\u63a2\u6d4b\u591a\u4e2a\u6781\u7aef\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u65cb\u8fdb\uff08EMRI\uff09\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u5206\u6790EMRI\u661f\u8868\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ea6\u675f\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u79cd\u7fa4\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u79cd\u7fa4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "EMRI\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5c06\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4e9a\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u4e2d\u81f4\u5bc6\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002LISA\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u8ba1\u5c06\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u591a\u4e2aEMRI\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u7ea6\u675f\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u79cd\u7fa4\u53ca\u5176\u5f62\u6210\u9014\u5f84\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u62df\u7684EMRI\u661f\u8868\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LISA\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u79cd\u7fa4\u6a21\u578b\u7ea6\u675f\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u79cd\u7fa4\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u5f02\u8d28\u548c\u540c\u8d28\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e9a\u79cd\u7fa4\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6545\u610f\u9519\u8bef\u8bbe\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5177\u6709\u5c16\u9510\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u79cd\u7fa4\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u4e25\u683c\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u79cd\u7fa4\u53ea\u9700\u7ea620\u4e2a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5373\u53ef\u88ab\u533a\u5206\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u63a8\u65ad\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u79cd\u7fa4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86EMRI\u79cd\u7fa4\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efaLISA\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u79cd\u7fa4\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u8868\u660eLISA\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7ea6\u675f\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u79cd\u7fa4\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}
