Phys. 147 (2023) 102794; arXiv:2205.05845). The authors concluded that two types of next-generation detectors are needed to answer these questions: high-accuracy instruments and detectors that maximize exposure at the highest energies. The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA), a proposed dual-satellite observatory, exemplifies the latter class and is designed to increase statistics of the highest-energy cosmic rays and to detect very-high-energy neutrinos following multi-messenger alerts. POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) implements a compact, balloon-borne version of the POEMMA concept, adapted for a Super-Pressure Balloon flight from Wanaka, New Zealand, with an expected campaign exceeding 20 days. PBR couples a wide field-of-view Schmidt telescope and a hybrid optical focal surface with a dedicated radio instrument to deliver simultaneous, complementary measurements of extensive air showers. The mission will validate the fluorescence detection strategy from space and raise technology readiness for a POEMMA-like space mission by observing UHECR-induced fluorescence light from suborbital altitudes, obtaining the first simultaneous optical Cherenkov and radio observations of high-altitude horizontal air showers above the cosmic-ray knee (E>3PeV), enabling energy-spectrum and composition studies at the PeV scale, and performing follow-ups of multi-messenger alerts to search for very-high-energy neutrinos via upward-going air showers.

Current glitch classification methods, such as Gravity Spy, rely on supervised models trained from scratch using labeled datasets. These approaches suffer from a significant ``label bottleneck,\" requiring massive, expertly annotated datasets to achieve high accuracy and often struggling to generalize to new glitch morphologies or exotic GW signals encountered in observing runs. In this work, we present a novel cross-domain framework that treats GW strain data through the lens of audio processing. We utilize the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a model pre-trained on large-scale audio datasets, and adapt it to the GW domain. Instead of learning time-frequency features from scratch, our method exploits the strong inductive bias inherent in pre-trained audio models, transferring learned representations of natural sound to the characterization of detector noise and GW signals, including IMBHs. We validate this approach by analyzing strain data from the third (O3) and fourth (O4) observing runs of the LIGO detectors. We used t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised clustering technique, to visualize the AST-derived embeddings of signals and glitches, revealing well-separated groups that align closely with independently validated Gravity Spy glitch classes. Our results indicate that the inductive bias from audio pre-training allows superior feature extraction compared to traditional supervised techniques, offering a robust, data-efficient pathway for discovering new, anomalous transients, and classifying complex noise artifacts in the era of next-generation detectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\uff08AST\uff09\u5904\u7406\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728O3\u548cO4\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Gravity Spy\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\"\u6807\u7b7e\u74f6\u9888\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u566a\u58f0\u5f62\u6001\u6216\u5947\u5f02\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u57df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5e94\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u89c6\u4e3a\u97f3\u9891\u5904\u7406\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u97f3\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Audio Spectrogram Transformer\uff08AST\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u9886\u57df\u3002\u5229\u7528t-SNE\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316AST\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728LIGO O3\u548cO4\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cAST\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u80fd\u6e05\u6670\u5206\u79bb\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u4e0eGravity Spy\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u97f3\u9891\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u97f3\u9891\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u5f02\u5e38\u77ac\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\u590d\u6742\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u65f6\u4ee3\u3002"}}

Published in The Astrophysical Journal", "summary": "Understanding the variability of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) requires coordinated, multi-wavelength observations that span the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work, we focus on data from four key observatories: Chandra in the X-ray (2-8 keV), GRAVITY on the Very Large Telescope in the near-infrared (2.2 microns), Spitzer in the infrared (4.5 microns), and ALMA in the submillimeter (340 GHz). These multi-band observations are essential for probing the physics of accretion and emission near the black hole's event horizon, yet they suffer from irregular sampling, band-dependent noise, and substantial data gaps. These limitations complicate efforts to robustly identify flares and measure cross-band time lags, key diagnostics of the physical processes driving variability. To address this challenge, we introduce a diffusion-based generative model, for interpolating sparse, multivariate astrophysical time series. This represents the first application of score-based diffusion models to astronomical time series. We also present the first transformer-based model for light curve reconstruction that includes calibrated uncertainty estimates.

The model's prediction of peak luminosity is based directly on recent global simulations that follow the disruption self-consistently and contains no tunable parameters related to the emission physics. We construct the predicted joint distribution of peak luminosity and black hole mass, including both full and partial disruptions, and compare it to a sample of observed TDEs using Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We find that the model reproduces the distribution in the ($M_{BH},L_{peak}$) plane for the bulk of the observed TDE population with good statistical consistency. The data strongly favor an old stellar population, with a sharp suppression of stars above $M_* \\simeq 1.5 - 2 M_\\odot$. They also indicate that, at fixed stellar mass, the volumetric TDE rate is nearly independent of black hole mass. Partial disruptions contribute a substantial fraction ($\\sim 30\\%$) of detected events in flux-limited samples and are essential for reproducing the observed distribution. The inferred population properties are robust to different approximations to the stellar mass-radius relation, although the event rate at high luminosity is sensitive to the form of this relation for massive stars.

We present the results from one such effort, the first 24,186 hours of the GREENBURST search for dispersed radio pulses with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). To date, GREENBURST has detected a total of 50 pulsars and three FRBs. One of the pulsars, PSR J0039+5407, has a period of 2.2 s and was previously unknown. Using follow-up observations with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, we found a timing solution for this pulsar which shows it to have a characteristic age of 2 Myr. Additional GBT observations show the pulsar has a very high nulling fraction ($\\sim70-80\\%$). All three of the FRBs are repeating sources that were previously known and were being monitored by the GBT as part of other projects. A major challenge for GREENBURST in the discovery of new FRBs is its single beam. This makes it hard to distinguish some of the pulses from sources of radio frequency interference. We highlight this problem with a case study of an FRB-like pulse that initially passed our interference filters. Upon closer inspection, the event appears to be part of a longer-duration narrow-band source of unknown origin. Further observations and monitoring are required to determine whether it is terrestrial or celestial.", "AI": {"tldr": "GREENBURST\u9879\u76ee\u5229\u7528\u7eff\u5cb8\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u534f\u540c\u89c2\u6d4b\u673a\u4f1a\u641c\u7d22\u5feb\u901f\u5c04\u7535\u66b4\uff0c\u572824,186\u5c0f\u65f6\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63a2\u6d4b\u523050\u9897\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u548c3\u4e2a\u5df2\u77e5\u91cd\u590d\u5feb\u901f\u5c04\u7535\u66b4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u9897\u65b0\u76842.2\u79d2\u5468\u671f\u8109\u51b2\u661f\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u6ce2\u675f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65b0\u5feb\u901f\u5c04\u7535\u66b4\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u5c04\u7535\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u534f\u540c\u89c2\u6d4b\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u89c2\u6d4b\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u5feb\u901f\u5c04\u7535\u66b4\u548c\u77ac\u53d8\u6e90\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c2\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u6269\u5927\u641c\u7d22\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7eff\u5cb8\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u8fdb\u884cGREENBURST\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5206\u679024,186\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u8272\u6563\u5c04\u7535\u8109\u51b2\u641c\u7d22\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u6c22\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6d4b\u7ed8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u540e\u7eed\u89c2\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8ba1\u65f6\u3002", "result": "\u63a2\u6d4b\u523050\u9897\u8109\u51b2\u661f\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u9897\u65b0\u76842.2\u79d2\u5468\u671f\u8109\u51b2\u661fPSR J0039+5407\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u96f6\u8109\u51b2\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff09\u548c3\u4e2a\u5df2\u77e5\u91cd\u590d\u5feb\u901f\u5c04\u7535\u66b4\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u6ce2\u675f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65b0\u5feb\u901f\u5c04\u7535\u66b4\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "GREENBURST\u9879\u76ee\u6210\u529f\u5229\u7528\u534f\u540c\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u8109\u51b2\u661f\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u6ce2\u675f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u533a\u5206\u5c04\u7535\u9891\u7387\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u76d1\u6d4b\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u67d0\u4e9b\u8109\u51b2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002"}}

Very close encounters cause extreme tidal compression in the WD, raising temperatures enough to induce runaway fusion and produce a thermonuclear supernova (SN). Using the hydrodynamics code AREPO augmented with a 55-isotope nuclear reaction network, we performed high-resolution simulations of the TDE of a $0.6$ Msun C/O WD by a $500$ Msun IMBH for different values of the scaled impact parameter $b$ (i.e., the ratio of periapsis distance to tidal radius). Closer encounters produce combined TDE+SN events, with a partial burning of $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O into heavier isotopes -- the $^{56}$Ni fractions of the disrupted WD material vary from 1% at $b = 0.19$ to 82% at $b = 0.10$, while wider ones ($b \\gtrsim 0.20$) lead to standard TDEs. In all cases, the material away from the denser regions remains unburnt, spanning a wide range of radial velocities. Such WD TDEs also exhibit a central cavity, wherein little material is found below a radial velocity of several $1000 \\,\\mathrm{km s}^{-1}$. We also performed 1D and 2D radiative-transfer calculations for these WD-TDEs using the codes CMFGEN and LONGPOL, respectively, covering epochs from a few days to one hundred days.

Astronomy across much of the electromagnetic spectrum has been fundamentally transformed with a rapid increase in ground-based and space-based capabilities to examine celestial objects on small scales that relate directly to their relevant physical processes. X-ray imaging capabilities, however, have fallen far behind observations at longer wavelengths. As such, without decisive advances in X-ray imaging, we will be unable to uncover key phenomena on the smallest astrophysical scales, leaving entire classes of high-energy discoveries beyond our reach. Here we describe several science goals for which high quality X-ray imaging is crucial and the status of some current technologies or mission concepts that would be required for these advances.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Observations of binary black hole (BBH) mergers provide a unique window into the lives of massive stars across cosmic time. Connecting redshift-dependent merger properties to massive star progenitors requires accurate models of cosmic star formation and chemical enrichment histories. Analytical fits for the metallicity-specific cosmic star formation rate density S(Z, z) are commonly used as proxies for the complex underlying star formation history, yet they remain unconstrained. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we evaluate the accuracy of these analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions and assess how simulation resolution and volume affect the inferred S(Z, z). By coupling the simulated and analytical S(Z, z) to the population synthesis code COMPAS, we investigate the resulting BBH merger rates and mass distributions. We find that analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions can overestimate BBH merger rates at high redshift ($z \\gtrsim 6$) by up to a factor of $10$-$10^4$, depending on cosmological simulation resolution, and can introduce spurious features in the BBH mass distribution. For example, they can produce an artificial feature near $8\\,M_\\odot$ in the primary mass distribution at $z \\lesssim 2$, which is absent when using the full simulation-based S(Z, z), while simultaneously suppressing high-mass features. These discrepancies arise because simple analytical models fail to capture a high-metallicity bump and a more flattened low-metallicity tail in the simulated S(Z, z) metallicity distribution. Our results highlight the importance of accurate star formation histories for modeling BBH populations, demonstrate the limitation of widely used analytical S(Z, z) fits, and underscore the need for careful integration of cosmological simulations, analytical fits, and population synthesis when interpreting gravitational-wave observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u7279\u5b9a\u5b87\u5b99\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6S(Z,z)\u89e3\u6790\u62df\u5408\u4f1a\u9ad8\u4f30\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5e76\u5408\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u5bf9\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5e76\u5408\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5b87\u5b99\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u7a97\u53e3\u3002\u5c06\u7ea2\u79fb\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5e76\u5408\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u589e\u4e30\u5386\u53f2\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5e38\u7528\u7684S(Z,z)\u89e3\u6790\u62df\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528IllustrisTNG\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30S(Z,z)\u89e3\u6790\u62df\u5408\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u4f53\u79ef\u5bf9S(Z,z)\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5c06\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u7684S(Z,z)\u4e0e\u79cd\u7fa4\u5408\u6210\u4ee3\u7801COMPAS\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7531\u6b64\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5e76\u5408\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u89e3\u6790S(Z,z)\u62df\u5408\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb(z\u22736)\u4f1a\u9ad8\u4f30\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5e76\u5408\u738710-10^4\u500d\uff08\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728z\u22722\u65f6\u4f1a\u5728\u4e3b\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f8M\u2299\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u4eba\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u62dfS(Z,z)\u65f6\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u6e90\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u62dfS(Z,z)\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u51f8\u8d77\u548c\u66f4\u5e73\u5766\u7684\u4f4e\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u5c3e\u90e8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u5bf9\u5efa\u6a21\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u79cd\u7fa4\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684S(Z,z)\u89e3\u6790\u62df\u5408\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u4ed4\u7ec6\u6574\u5408\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u62df\u5408\u548c\u79cd\u7fa4\u5408\u6210\u3002"}}

Spatially, a new extended $\u03b3$-ray component distinct from the emission associated with the H$\u03b1$ filaments of the SNR shell is identified. This new component exhibits a strong spatial correlation with dense molecular clouds (MCs) identified in CO emission at Local Standard of Rest velocities of $0$-$5\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. Spectrally, the cloud-associated emission implies an underlying cosmic-ray (CR) proton population described by a hard power law with an index of $\u0393\\approx 2.1$, compatible with the standard diffusive shock acceleration prediction. We interpret the $\u03b3$-ray emission in this region with a hadronic scenario involving two distinct CR populations: trapped CRs reaccelerated within the radiative SNR shell as proposed in previous work, and escaping CRs illuminating the nearby MCs. The derived CR proton intensity in the MC region significantly exceeds the local Galactic background measured by AMS-02, strongly suggesting that the cloud is illuminated by particles accelerated by S147. These findings provide observational evidence for CR escape during the earlier evolutionary phases of this middle-aged SNR and highlight S147 as a promising candidate for detection at TeV energies by LHAASO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u752816.5\u5e74Fermi-LAT\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8001\u5e74\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9S147\u7684\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u65b0\u6269\u5c55\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u9003\u79bb\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u8d28\u5b50\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u9003\u9038\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8001\u5e74\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9S147\u7684\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u9003\u9038\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e86\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u5728\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u6f14\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea616.5\u5e74\u7684Fermi-LAT\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eCO\u53d1\u5c04\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7a20\u5bc6\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u5f3a\u70c8\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u786c\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u0393\u22482.1\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u8d28\u5b50\u7fa4\uff0c\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8fc7\u672c\u5730\u94f6\u6cb3\u80cc\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "S147\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u7fa4\uff1a\u5728\u8f90\u5c04\u58f3\u4e2d\u518d\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u88ab\u56f0\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u7167\u4eae\u9644\u8fd1\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u7684\u9003\u9038\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u8001\u5e74\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u65e9\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u9003\u9038\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

Starting from the exact Laplace-space solution derived from the generalized master equation with memory kernel $K(t) \\propto t^{-\u03bd}e^{-t/\u03c4_c}$, we develop a systematic perturbation expansion in the turbulence strength parameter $\u03be$. The expansion is performed around the high-density matter basis where $\\cos 2\u03b8_m \\approx 1$, rather than the vacuum basis, reflecting the physical conditions in supernova cores. We obtain explicit expressions for the first few perturbation terms and derive the general structure of higher-order terms, which involve Mittag-Leffler functions that emerge from the fractional dynamics. Using high-precision numerical methods (multiple-precision arithmetic and asymptotic expansions), we analyze the convergence radius and rate of the perturbation series. We find that for $\u03be< \u03be_c \\approx 0.8$, the series converges with error decreasing geometrically. For $\u03be= 0.16$ (typical supernova conditions), third-order perturbation theory achieves $\\sim 1\\%$ accuracy. We provide practical guidelines for applying perturbation theory to realistic astrophysical scenarios and validate all analytical results with extensive numerical computations. Our work clarifies several subtle aspects of the perturbative approach that were not addressed in the original literature, offering a complete toolkit for researchers studying neutrino-turbulence interactions. In particular, we systematically address the ultraviolet divergence of the correlation function at short time scales for spectral indices $\u03bd\\geq 1$, introducing a physical small-scale cutoff regularization that ensures mathematical rigor for the fractional master equation and perturbative expansion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u5728\u5e42\u5f8b\u76f8\u5173\u6e4d\u6d41\u7269\u8d28\u4e2d\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u5fae\u6270\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u5728\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u6838\u5fc3\u7b49\u6e4d\u6d41\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5fae\u6270\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50-\u6e4d\u6d41\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5177\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6838K(t)\u221dt^{-\u03bd}e^{-t/\u03c4_c}\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5728\u6e4d\u6d41\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u03be\u5468\u56f4\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5fae\u6270\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u5c55\u5f00\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7269\u8d28\u57fa\u800c\u975e\u771f\u7a7a\u57fa\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u524d\u51e0\u9636\u5fae\u6270\u9879\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u9ad8\u9636\u9879\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u03be<\u03be_c\u22480.8\u65f6\u7ea7\u6570\u51e0\u4f55\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u5728\u5178\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u6761\u4ef6\u03be=0.16\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e09\u9636\u5fae\u6270\u7406\u8bba\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea61%\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8c31\u6307\u6570\u03bd\u22651\u65f6\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u53d1\u6563\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u5728\u6e4d\u6d41\u7269\u8d28\u4e2d\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5fae\u6270\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u5fae\u5999\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4e3a\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002"}}

Recent theoretical and observational studies indicate a diversity of progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms. In the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, the diversity in Fe-K$\u03b1$ centroid energies and line luminosities suggests variations in the underlying explosion mechanisms. X-ray spectra of SNRs, which trace shocked ejecta and the surrounding medium, are crucial diagnostics of progenitor systems and explosion physics. Thanks to recent advances in spectroscopy with XRISM, high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy enables 3-D diagnostics, including line-of-sight velocities. In this study, we perform 3-D hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs from six Type Ia explosion models: two each of pure deflagration, delayed detonation, and double detonation. Each model is evolved for 1000 years in a uniform medium, consistently accounting for non-equilibrium ionization. Our efficient numerical scheme enables systematic parameter surveys in full 3-D. From these models, we synthesize X-ray spectra with $\\sim$1 eV resolution, exceeding XRISM/Resolve's spectral resolution. This work presents the first calculation of X-ray spectra for Type Ia SNRs derived from 3-D hydrodynamic simulations that follow the evolution self-consistently from the SN phase into the SNR phase. Our results show inter-model diversity in the X-ray spectra. Asymmetric, red- and blueshifted line profiles arise from the 3-D ejecta distributions. These findings demonstrate that 3-D SNR modeling can reproduce the observed diversity of Type Ia SNRs and provide qualitative constraints on progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc73D\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4ece6\u79cdIa\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7206\u70b8\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u5230\u9057\u8ff9\u76f8\u7684\u81ea\u6d3d\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5149\u8c31\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u7ea2\u84dd\u79fb\u7ebf\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u867d\u7136\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u6807\u51c6\u70db\u5149\uff0c\u4f46\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u8868\u660e\u5176\u524d\u8eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7206\u70b8\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u9636\u6bb5\u7684Fe-K\u03b1\u7ebf\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u5149\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e5f\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u7206\u70b8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u8c31\uff08\u5982XRISM\uff09\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ef4\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ece\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u5230\u9057\u8ff9\u76f8\u7684\u81ea\u6d3d\u4e09\u7ef4\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u7ef4\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u516d\u79cdIa\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7206\u70b8\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7eaf\u7206\u71c3\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7206\u8f70\u3001\u53cc\u7206\u8f70\u5404\u4e24\u79cd\uff09\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5747\u5300\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u6f14\u53161000\u5e74\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u6d3d\u8003\u8651\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7535\u79bb\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7ea61 eV\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u8c31\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u95f4X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u8c31\u5448\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e09\u7ef4\u629b\u5c04\u7269\u5206\u5e03\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u7ea2\u84dd\u79fb\u7ebf\u8f6e\u5ed3\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u4ece\u4e09\u7ef4\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u81ea\u6d3d\u6f14\u5316\u5f97\u5230\u7684Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u8c31\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u91cd\u73b0\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u9057\u8ff9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e09\u7ef4\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u591f\u91cd\u73b0Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u524d\u8eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7206\u70b8\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u7206\u70b8\u7269\u7406\u3002"}}

To assess the statistical significance of periodic features embedded in red-noise-dominated variability, we apply several complementary timing techniques, including the Lomb--Scargle periodogram, weighted wavelet $Z$-transform, date-compensated discrete Fourier transform, REDFIT assuming an AR(1) process, and damped random walk modelling. The analyses reveal a dominant quasi-periodic modulation on a timescale of $\\sim600$--630~d, together with a secondary longer-timescale feature near $\\sim1050$--1110~d. Monte Carlo simulations show that the shorter-period signal exceeds the highest local confidence levels, while the longer modulation reaches $\\gtrsim99$ per cent local significance in several tests; independent DRW-based simulations place both peaks above the $4\u03c3$ envelope in the Lomb--Scargle analysis. Spectral-window diagnostics indicate that the detected periodicities are not artefacts of uneven sampling, and a sliding-window analysis shows that the QPO power is episodic across the $\\sim11$~yr baseline.

While near-horizon magnetic field is usually assumed to originate from the accretion flow, additional large-scale magnetic fields - such as those supplied by a companion neutron star in stellar-mass binaries or by galactic fields around supermassive black holes - may also affect the horizon-threading flux. In this work, we study the superposition of a weak arbitrarily inclined external uniform magnetic field with the internal Blandford-Znajek split-monopole field around a Schwarzschild black hole. This setup generically gives rise to magnetic null points, where the total field vanishes. We compute the magnetic flux through an arbitrarily tilted hemisphere of the event horizon and show that the flux can be substantially suppressed by the external field. In the axisymmetric case, the flux can even vanish completely. However, with nonzero inclination, complete cancellation becomes impossible, despite significant reduction. We further explore the ionization and subsequent particle acceleration from a Keplerian accretion disk, finding that efficient collimated outflows persist even under significant field inclination. We show that the acceleration is critically dependent on the external field orientation, with the escape fraction maximized at non-zero inclinations due to the destabilization of trapping zones and minimized in the anti-aligned configuration, where closed magnetic loops effectively suppress the outflow. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these findings, proposing that geometric flux cancellation can serve as a mechanism for jet quenching in compact binaries and offering an explanation for the lack of a prominent large-scale jet in Sgr A*.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u5f31\u5916\u90e8\u5747\u5300\u78c1\u573a\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8Blandford-Znajek\u5206\u88c2\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u573a\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u754c\u7684\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u55b7\u6d41\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u78c1\u573a\u8d77\u7740\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u8ba4\u4e3a\u89c6\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u6765\u81ea\u5438\u79ef\u6d41\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\uff08\u5982\u6765\u81ea\u4f34\u661f\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u6216\u661f\u7cfb\u78c1\u573a\uff09\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u89c6\u754c\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u53e0\u52a0\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u55b7\u6d41\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f31\u4efb\u610f\u503e\u659c\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u5747\u5300\u78c1\u573a\u4e0eSchwarzschild\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u5185\u90e8Blandford-Znajek\u5206\u88c2\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u573a\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u610f\u503e\u659c\u534a\u7403\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u754c\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u78c1\u573a\u96f6\u70b9\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4ece\u5f00\u666e\u52d2\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7684\u7535\u79bb\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u754c\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\uff0c\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u5931\u3002\u975e\u96f6\u503e\u89d2\u65f6\u5b8c\u5168\u62b5\u6d88\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u7387\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u975e\u96f6\u503e\u89d2\u65f6\u9003\u9038\u5206\u6570\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u53cd\u5e73\u884c\u914d\u7f6e\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u3002\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u76f4\u5916\u6d41\u5728\u663e\u8457\u78c1\u573a\u503e\u89d2\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u62b5\u6d88\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81f4\u5bc6\u53cc\u661f\u4e2d\u55b7\u6d41\u6291\u5236\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aSgr A*\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u8457\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u55b7\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u78c1\u573a\u53e0\u52a0\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u55b7\u6d41\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u3002"}}

(2020, 2024), appropriate for early times (t~1hour after merger). We explore jets with different powers and opening angles. We find that the presence of the jet shifts the spectral peak to longer wavelengths, with the strongest effect near the polar viewing angle. This occurs because the jet creates a thin, low-density outer layer ahead of the bulk ejecta. The opacity of this layer can be as high as kappa ~200 cm2/g, causing photons to escape from cooler, faster-moving outer layer rather than from the hot inner ejecta. The bolometric light curves likewise exhibit a clear imprint of the jet-ejecta interaction, showing suppressed early-time luminosity near polar viewing angles compared to the equatorial one, as the photosphere resides in this thin layer where radioactive heating is lower than in the bulk ejecta. These signatures are also evident in multi-color light curves, particularly in the ultraviolet and u-bands. In the Swift-UVW2 band at t~= 0.15 days for a source at 100 Mpc, the ultraviolet luminosities can reach ~ 19.5 mag if no jet is present, while the presence of the jet can make it fainter by ~ 2.5 mag. The strongest observational signature occurs in the UVEX-NUV, Swift-UVW2, and UVM2 bands, which remains detectable out to viewing angles of ~ 60 deg for t <=1 days.
