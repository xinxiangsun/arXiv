Especially below 100 MHz,\nphase unwrapping difficulties and higher-order dispersion effects can\ncomplicate the separation of ionospheric and clock delays. Aims: We address\nthis challenge by introducing a method for reliably separating clock delays\nfrom ionospheric effects, even under mediocre to poor ionospheric conditions\nencountered near solar maximum. Methods: The approach employs a key technique:\nwe modelled our likelihood space using the circular Gaussian distribution (von\nMises random variable) rather than non-circular distributions that suffer from\n$2\\pi$ phase ambiguities. This ensures that noisier data are weighted less\nheavily than cleaner data during the fitting process. Results: The method\nreliably separates clock delays and ionospheric terms that vary smoothly in\ntime whilst providing a good fit to the data. A comparison with the\nclock-ionosphere separation approach used in standard LOFAR data processing\nshows that our technique achieves significant improvements. In contrast to the\nold algorithm, which often fails to return reliable results below 100 MHz even\nunder good ionospheric conditions, the new algorithm consistently provides\nreliable solutions across a wider range of conditions.

The bursts of radio activity in most cases are\nlikely due to intrinsic changes in the accretion processes. However, for a few\nsources in this sample, we cannot rule out the possibility that their radio\nvariability results from a tidal disruption event (TDE). In this work, we\nextend our analysis to the optical and infrared regimes, confirming that our\nsample of radio transients is not homogeneous in terms of their optical and\ninfrared properties either. The host galaxies of most of these sources are\nmassive ellipticals with emission dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN).\nThey host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses typical of radio-loud\nAGNs ($\\rm >10^7\\,M_{\\odot}$), but exhibit very low accretion activity. In\ncontrast, the sources for which a TDE origin is suspected are either pure\nstar-forming galaxies or show significant ongoing star formation, similar to\nradio-selected optically-detected TDEs. Additionally, two of them exhibit\ninfrared flares characteristic of TDEs, while the remaining sources do not\ndisplay significant variability outside the radio regime. Moreover, the\nevolution of their radio brightness in the W3/radio diagnostic diagram, which\nwe employ in our analysis, also sets our TDE candidates apart from the rest of\nthe sample and resembles the radio variability seen in optically discovered\nTDEs with radio emission. Finally, based on our findings, we hypothesize that\nthe mid-IR/radio relation can serve as a tool to distinguish between radio\ntransients caused by TDEs and those originating from intrinsic AGN variability."}

However, several key\nparameters influencing the EOS, such as the maximum mass of neutron stars,\nspin-down rates, and the potential role of exotic matter in their cores, remain\nsubject of ongoing debate. Here we present a new approach to constraining the\nEOS by analyzing the X-ray afterglows of some short gamma-ray bursts, focusing\non \"the internal plateau\" phase and its abrupt decay, which reflect the\nspin-down and possible collapse of a supra-massive neutron star into a black\nhole. By linking critical neutron star masses with black hole formation\ncriteria and the observational data from Swift's BAT and XRT instruments with\ncompact object models, we explore three representative EOSs that range from\n\"soft\" to \"stiff\". Our result supports a maximum mass for neutron stars of\napproximately 2.39 solar masses at the threshold of black hole formation. This\nconclusion holds under assumptions of magnetar-powered X-ray plateaus, constant\nradiative efficiency, isotropic emission, and full Kerr black hole energy\nextraction; deviations could influence the inferred results. Our results\ndemonstrate the critical role of neutron star/black hole physics in probing\ndense nuclear matter and provide a novel framework for exploring extreme\nastrophysical environments."}

On 22nd February 2024, during its\ndaily Galactic center monitoring, Swift-XRT detected a VFXT, 7 arcmin from Sgr\nA* dubbing it Swift J174610--290018. We aim to characterize the outburst that\noccurred in 2024, and a second, distinct outburst in 2025, to understand the\nnature and accretion flow properties of this new VFXT. Swift-XRT light curves\nare used to constrain the duration of the two events. We carried out X-ray\nspectral analysis exploiting XMM and NuSTAR data. We used Chandra and XMM\nobservations of the last 25 years to constrain the quiescent luminosity of the\nsource. During the 2024 outburst, which lasted about 50 days, the source\nreached a luminosity in the 2-10 keV band of L_X = 1.2e35 erg s^-1 (assuming it\nis located at the Galactic center). The 2025 outburst is shorter (about 5\ndays), and reached L_X = 9e34 erg s^-1. The spectral features of the source\ninclude an excess at 6.5-7 keV, which can be associated either with a single\nreflection line or with the ionized Fe XXV and XXVI lines. The same source was\nidentified in both the XMM and Chandra catalogs of point sources (known as 4XMM\nJ174610.7--290020). During previous detections, the source displayed luminosity\nlevels ranging from L_X= 2e32 to L_X = 3e34 erg s^-1 between 2000 and 2010.\nMoreover, it exhibited a potential type I X-ray burst in 2004. The analysis of\nthe outbursts and the potential type I burst strongly suggests the neutron star\nlow mass X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) nature of the VFXT. The source can be described\nby an accretion disk corona (as has been recently proposed by the XRISM/Xtend\nanalysis). This scenario explains the overall low luminosity of this transient\nand the peculiar iron lines in the spectrum."}

The first of these is a\npayload optimised to perform Compton polarimetry measurements in the 40-1000\nkeV energy range using a combination of plastic scintillators and SiPMs. The\ndevelopment of this payload, the design of which is based on lessons learned\nfrom the POLAR mission, included optimization of plastic scintillator design.\nIn addition, its development included detailed characterization, space\nqualification and radiation damage and mitigation strategies for the large\nnumber of silicon photo-multipliers included in the design.

As such, its design is of interest beyond this polarimeter and is\nalso used on the spectrometer instrument of POLAR-2 where it is used to read\nout an array of GAGG:Ce scintillators. This readout, in combination with a\ncoded mask, allows this secondary instrument to provide detailed spectral and\nlocalization measurements. The final instrument used in the mission aims to use\ngas-based detectors to perform polarization measurements in the keV energy\nregion. The novelty of this design is that it will be optimized to use these\nfor wide field of view observations. The combination of the three instruments\nwill allow to perform detailed spectral, localization and polarization\nmeasurements of these transient phenomena together for the first time.
