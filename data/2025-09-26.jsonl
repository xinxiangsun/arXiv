Presented at the AIAA 2025 Regional Student\n  Conference", "summary": "This paper presents UNAGI, a novel spacecraft mission developed by Spartan\nSpace Systems, a student engineering team at San Jose State University, aiming\nfor the first controlled landing on Jupiter's volcanically active moon Io.\nInspired by the Japanese freshwater eel's agility, UNAGI employs an\nelectrodynamic tether system that interacts with Jupiter's magnetic field to\ngenerate Lorentz forces, enabling dynamic modulation of the spacecraft's\nvelocity without the need for traditional propellant. This system allows the\nspacecraft to precisely match Io's orbital velocity, similar to a surfer riding\na wave. By optimizing tether current and orientation, UNAGI transitions from an\nouter Jovian insertion orbit to an orbit around Io, achieving a controlled\nlanding for on-surface science operations. The landing is strategically timed,\nleveraging the gravitational influence of Jupiter and its moons to decelerate\ndescent and mitigate impact forces.\n  UNAGI leverages technologies from missions like Juno, JUICE, and Europa\nClipper to ensure reliable operation in the challenging Jovian environment. The\nmission follows a phased approach, including cruise, orbital insertion, tether\ndeployment, Jovian orbital operations, and final descent, with extensive risk\nmitigation through simulations and experimental validation. The concept\nsupports rideshare integration on future NASA or ESA missions or a dedicated\nlaunch, emphasizing cost effectiveness and adaptability. UNAGI carries a\nscientific payload including infrared spectrometers, magnetometers,\nseismometers, and chromatographs, designed to probe Io's interior dynamics,\nvolcanic activity, tectonic deformation, and magnetospheric interactions. This\nmission aims to advance understanding of Io's geophysical processes and Jupiter\nsystem dynamics, setting a new standard for deep space exploration of extreme\nenvironments."}

Traditional methods often rely on maximizing the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N) as a criterion for aperture selection. However,\nS/N-based approaches do not necessarily provide the optimal precision for joint\nestimation problems as they do not account for the statistical limits imposed\nby the Fisher information in the context of the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound\n(CRLB). This study aims to establish an alternative criterion for selecting the\noptimal fitting radius based on Fisher information rather than S/N. Fisher\ninformation serves as a fundamental measure of estimation precision, providing\ntheoretical guarantees on the achievable accuracy for parameter estimation. By\nleveraging Fisher information, we seek to define an aperture selection strategy\nthat minimizes the loss of precision. We conducted a series of numerical\nexperiments that analyze the behavior of Fisher information and estimator\nperformance as a function of the PSF aperture radius.

Traditional pulsar timing techniques\nrefine these estimates by including them as free parameters when fitting a\nmodel to observed pulse time-of-arrival measurements. However, reliable\nsub-milliarcsecond astrometric estimations require years of observations and,\neven then, power from red noise can be inadvertently absorbed into astrometric\nparameter fits, biasing the resulting estimations and reducing our sensitivity\nto red noise processes, including gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we\nseek to mitigate these shortcomings by using pulsar astrometric estimates\nderived from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) as priors for the timing\nfit. First, we calibrated a frame tie to account for the offsets between the\nreference frames used in VLBI and timing. Then, we used the VLBI-informed\npriors and timing-based likelihoods of several astrometric solutions consistent\nwith both techniques to obtain a maximum-posterior astrometric solution. We\nfound offsets between our results and the timing-based astrometric solutions,\nwhich, if real, would lead to absorption of spectral power at frequencies of\ninterest for single-source GW searches.

This work presents a detailed performance assessment of the LACT\narray, focusing on the IRFs for both an 8-telescope subarray configuration\noptimized for large zenith angle observations (60{\\deg}) and the full\n32-telescope array, with a particular emphasis on a 20{\\deg} zenith angle\nconfiguration for lower energy threshold observations.\n  We have generated IRFs using extensive Monte Carlo simulations of gamma-ray\nshowers and the detector response. The IRFs include the effective area, angular\nresolution, and energy resolution as a function of energy and offset angle.\nCrucially, these IRFs are produced in the standard Data format for Gamma ray\nastronomy (GADF), ensuring interoperability with existing analysis tools like\nGammapy and ctools and enabling seamless integration into scientific workflows.\n  In this work, we also have used these GADF-format IRFs to simulate\nobservations towards the Galactic Center Region."}

During the\norbital decay of the inner BHB, the apsidal precession rate of the inner binary\nmatches that of the outer stellar orbit, and this resonance advection can drive\nthe outer eccentricity into some extreme values. For a Gaia BH3-like system, we\nshow that a near equal-mass ($q=0.8$) BHB with an initial semi-major axis of\n1--3 au and an initial eccentricity $\\gtrsim 0.95$ is able to excite the outer\norbit to the observed value, leaving a current BHB with semi-major axis\n0.25--0.5 au and eccentricity $\\sim 0.8$.

Traditional pulsar timing techniques\nrefine these estimates by including them as free parameters when fitting a\nmodel to observed pulse time-of-arrival measurements. However, reliable\nsub-milliarcsecond astrometric estimations require years of observations and,\neven then, power from red noise can be inadvertently absorbed into astrometric\nparameter fits, biasing the resulting estimations and reducing our sensitivity\nto red noise processes, including gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we\nseek to mitigate these shortcomings by using pulsar astrometric estimates\nderived from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) as priors for the timing\nfit. First, we calibrated a frame tie to account for the offsets between the\nreference frames used in VLBI and timing. Then, we used the VLBI-informed\npriors and timing-based likelihoods of several astrometric solutions consistent\nwith both techniques to obtain a maximum-posterior astrometric solution. We\nfound offsets between our results and the timing-based astrometric solutions,\nwhich, if real, would lead to absorption of spectral power at frequencies of\ninterest for single-source GW searches.
