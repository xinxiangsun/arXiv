ADASS 2025", "summary": "Since 2004, the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) has operated as a NASA-funded collaboration between the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute ( NExScI) and the W.M. Keck Observatory. It ingests and serves all data acquired by the twin 10-meter Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. In the past three years, KOA has begun a modernization program to replace the architecture and systems used since the archive's creation with a new modern Python-based infrastructure. This infrastructure will position KOA to respond to the rapid growth of new and complex data sets that will be acquired by new instruments now in development, and enable follow-up to identify the deluge of alerts of transient sources expected by new survey telescopes such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Since 2022, KOA has ingested new data in near-real time, generally within one minute of creation, and has made them immediately accessible to observers through a dedicated web interface. The archive is now deploying a new, scalable, Python-based, VO-compliant query infrastructure built with the Plotly-Dash framework and R-tree indices to speed-up queries by a factor of 20.\n  The project described here exploits the new query infrastructure to develop a dashboard that will return live metrics on the performance and growth of the archive. These metrics assess the current health of the archive and guide planning future hardware and software upgrades. This single dashboard will enable, for example, monitoring of real-time ingestion, as well as studying the long-term growth of the archive. Current methods of gathering metrics that have been in place since the archive opened will not support the archive as it continues to scale. These methods suffer from high latency, are not optimized for on-demand metrics, are scattered among various tools, and are cumbersome to use.", "AI": {"tldr": "Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) \u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u9879\u76ee\uff1a\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8ePython\u7684\u65b0\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u4eea\u8868\u677f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u77ac\u53d8\u6e90\u8b66\u62a5\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "KOA\u9700\u8981\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u4eea\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u77ac\u53d8\u6e90\u8b66\u62a5\uff08\u5982Vera C.

Linear variable filters mounted in front of six H2RG detectors produce a position dependent spectral response across the focal plane.\n  This paper presents the ground-based spectral calibration of SPHEREx, including the cryogenic apparatus, optical configuration, measurement strategy, analysis pipeline, and resulting calibration products. Monochromatic wavelength scans are used to derive the spectral response function, band center, and resolving power for every pixel. Band centers are measured to better than 1nm for Bands 1 through 4 (0.75 to 3.82um) and better than 10nm for Bands 5 and 6 (3.82 to 5.0um). Out-of-band leakage is negligible for detectors above 1.64um and is present at the percent level below this wavelength. The resolving power is measured to within 5% and agrees with design expectations to within 10%.\n  An on-sky spectrum of the Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543) constructed from repeated observations provides in-flight verification and shows agreement between ground calibrated response and astrophysical emission features. Calibration products, including per-pixel band center and resolving power maps, are released through IPAC to support community use of SPHEREx data. The absolute spectral calibration will continue to improve through in-flight measurements, with further reductions in uncertainty expected for the longest-wavelength bands.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPHEREx\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u7684\u5730\u9762\u5149\u8c31\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u53ca\u98de\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1", "motivation": "SPHEREx\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u9996\u4e2a\u5168\u5929\u7a7a\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u5de1\u5929\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6821\u51c6\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u6e29\u88c5\u7f6e\u3001\u5149\u5b66\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u5355\u8272\u6ce2\u957f\u626b\u63cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u50cf\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u8c31\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u6ce2\u6bb5\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf", "result": "\u6ce2\u6bb51-4\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6ce2\u957f\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8e1nm\uff0c\u6ce2\u6bb55-6\u4f18\u4e8e10nm\uff1b\u5e26\u5916\u6cc4\u6f0f\u57281.64\u03bcm\u4ee5\u4e0a\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e3a\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u57285%\u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9884\u671f\u76f8\u5dee10%\u4ee5\u5185", "conclusion": "\u5730\u9762\u6821\u51c6\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u732b\u773c\u661f\u4e91\u89c2\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u6821\u51c6\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u4ea7\u54c1\u5df2\u901a\u8fc7IPAC\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u7edd\u5bf9\u5149\u8c31\u6821\u51c6\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7\u98de\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb"}}

CPS consists of a constellation of radio antennas distributed across the outer Solar System, operating on baselines of tens of astronomical units. By precisely timing the arrival of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs), CPS infers source distances via trilateration -- analogous to global navigation satellite systems such as GPS but on cosmological scales.\n  We show that CPS distance measurements could result in sub-percent constraints on the Hubble constant with even a handful of detections, whereas we predict that 10-100 FRB sources are likely visible. We evaluate dominant sources of uncertainty -- wavefront timing precision, interstellar refractive delays, spacecraft positional knowledge, and onboard clock stability -- finding these controllable at required levels using near-term technologies. Our nominal design employs five spacecraft with 8 m deployable antennas, 3-6 GHz receivers with sub-30 K system temperatures, and space-qualified atomic clocks similar to those on GPS satellites, supported by a ground network for ranging calibration and FRB alerts.\n  Beyond cosmic expansion, CPS may enable frontier measurements in astrophysics and fundamental physics, including constraints on small-scale dark matter structure, microhertz gravitational waves (bridging pulsar timing arrays and LISA), and the outer Solar System mass distribution.

To efficiently explore such data requires automated methods that can extract and organize physically meaningful information, ideally without the need for extensive manual interaction. We aim to provide a user-friendly implementation of a self-supervised machine learning framework to explore morphological properties of large datasets, based on the BYOL (Bootstrap Your Own Latents) method. By enabling the generation of meaningful image embeddings without manually labelled data, the framework will enable key tasks such as clustering, anomaly detection, and similarity based exploration. In contrast to existing BYOL implementations, astromorph accommodates data of varying dimensions and resolutions, including both single-channel FITS images and multi-channel spectral cubes. The package is built with usability in mind, offering streamlined pipeline scripts for ease of use as well as deeper customization options via PyTorch-based classes. To demonstrate the utility of astromorph, we apply it in two contrasting science cases representing different astronomical domains: images of protoplanetary disks observed with ALMA, and infrared dark clouds observed with Spitzer and Herschel. In both cases, we demonstrate how astromorph produces scientifically meaningful embeddings that capture morphological differences and similarities across large samples. astromorph enables users to apply a robust, label-free approach for uncovering morphological patterns in astronomical datasets. The successful application to two markedly different datasets suggest that the pipeline is broadly applicable across a wide range of imaging-rich astronomical context, providing a user friendly tool for advancing discovery in observational astronomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "astromorph\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eBYOL\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5929\u6587\u56fe\u50cf\u5f62\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684FITS\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u5149\u8c31\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u4ea7\u751f\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u590d\u6742\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eBYOL\uff08Bootstrap Your Own Latents\uff09\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5355\u901a\u9053FITS\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u591a\u901a\u9053\u5149\u8c31\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u811a\u672c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8ePyTorch\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b9a\u5236\u9009\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u79d1\u5b66\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1aALMA\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caSpitzer\u548cHerschel\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u6697\u4e91\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0castromorph\u90fd\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5f62\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "astromorph\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u5929\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u622a\u7136\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6210\u50cf\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5929\u6587\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c2\u6d4b\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Their uniformity is credited to their single origin as thermonuclear explosions of White dwarf (WD) stars. Nevertheless, some SNe Ia break this regularity. Prominently, the Iax subclass are less energetic and remarkably diverse, raising questions about their progenitor systems. While no progenitor system of a normal SN Ia has ever been detected, a luminous blue star was identified in pre-explosion images of the site of the bright SN Iax SN 2012Z, suggested to be a helium giant companion star acting as a mass donor to a WD SN progenitor. This is in line with models of weak mass accretion of a WD from a binary companion, producing an explosion that does not fully disrupt the star. However, these models fail to explain the properties of the faintest Type Iax explosions, suggesting either they originate from other WD binary systems, or even from massive progenitor stars. Here, we present the faint SN Iax SN 2024vjm - possibly the faintest supernova observed to date. Using a deep pre-explosion image taken by the recently launched Euclid space mission, we show that its progenitor system must be fainter than the helium giant SN Iax progenitor candidate of SN 2012Z, as well as that of the luminous red companion or remnant of the faint SN 2008ha, and may require a subdwarf helium star as a mass donor. The deep image also provides strong arguments against a massive star origin for this faint supernova. Our observations argue that SN 2024vjm is a WD explosion, but we find that remarkably faint SNe Iax fade more slowly than bright ones, i.e., they evolve in an opposite manner from the famous Phillips relation that makes regular SNe Ia cosmological candles.", "AI": {"tldr": "SN 2024vjm\u662f\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6700\u6697\u7684Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\uff0c\u5176\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u5df2\u77e5\u7684Iax\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u66f4\u6697\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6d89\u53ca\u4e9a\u77ee\u6c26\u661f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d28\u91cf\u4f9b\u4f53\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u4e0e\u6b63\u5e38\u7684Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u76f8\u53cd\u3002", "motivation": "Iax\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u4f5c\u4e3aIa\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u6b8a\u5b50\u7c7b\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u8f83\u4f4e\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u6027\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5176\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u3002\u867d\u7136SN 2012Z\u7684\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u88ab\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u6c26\u5de8\u661f\u4f34\u661f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u6700\u6697\u7684Iax\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u8d77\u6e90\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u592a\u7a7a\u4efb\u52a1\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u6df1\u7a7a\u9884\u7206\u53d1\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790SN 2024vjm\u7684\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4eae\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eSN 2012Z\u548cSN 2008ha\u7684\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "SN 2024vjm\u7684\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4SN 2012Z\u7684\u6c26\u5de8\u661f\u5019\u9009\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u66f4\u6697\uff0c\u4e5f\u6bd4SN 2008ha\u7684\u660e\u4eae\u7ea2\u8272\u4f34\u661f\u6216\u6b8b\u9ab8\u66f4\u6697\u3002\u89c2\u6d4b\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u8d77\u6e90\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u7206\u70b8\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u6697Iax\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u6bd4\u4eaeIax\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u8870\u51cf\u66f4\u6162\uff0c\u4e0e\u6b63\u5e38Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684Phillips\u5173\u7cfb\u76f8\u53cd\u3002", "conclusion": "SN 2024vjm\u662f\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u7206\u70b8\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\uff0c\u5176\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u6d89\u53ca\u4e9a\u77ee\u6c26\u661f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d28\u91cf\u4f9b\u4f53\u3002\u6697Iax\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u4e0e\u6b63\u5e38Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3Iax\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Current models aimed at explaining the observed multiwavelength flares in Sgr A* often assume hotspots moving on geodesic, Keplerian orbits. In many scenarios, though, a hotspot may instead follow an inspiraling trajectory, potentially transitioning into a plunge toward the black hole. In this work, we present a general framework to simulate the polarized emission from generic equatorial inspiraling hotspots in Kerr spacetime using a parametric four-velocity profile. This parametrization defines a continuous family of flows, ranging from Cunningham's disk model (fixed radius orbits outside the innermost stable circular orbit and plunging motion within the innermost stable circular orbit) to purely radial motion, thereby extending the standard assumptions. Within this framework, we show that inspiral motion produces a distinctive observational signature: a precessing, unwinding evolution of the polarimetric Stokes Q-U looping pattern, in sharp contrast with the closed Q-U loops associated with stable orbits at a fixed radius. We then explore how the morphology of these signatures depends on black hole spin, observer inclination, and magnetic-field configuration. The presented model can be applied to current and near-future interferometric observations of linear polarization, offering a new avenue to probe the physics of matter spiraling inward and the relativistic velocities of plunging plasma.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u514b\u5c14\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8d64\u9053\u9762\u5185\u65cb\u70ed\u70b9\u504f\u632f\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u56db\u901f\u5ea6\u5256\u9762\uff0c\u53ef\u63cf\u8ff0\u4eceCunningham\u76d8\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u7eaf\u5f84\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u65cf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5185\u65cb\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ea7\u751f\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u504f\u632fQ-U\u73af\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91caSgr A*\u591a\u6ce2\u957f\u8000\u6591\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u70ed\u70b9\u6cbf\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5f00\u666e\u52d2\u8f68\u9053\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u70ed\u70b9\u53ef\u80fd\u6cbf\u5185\u65cb\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u80fd\u5760\u5165\u9ed1\u6d1e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u6807\u51c6\u5047\u8bbe\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5185\u65cb\u70ed\u70b9\u7684\u504f\u632f\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u6a21\u62df\u514b\u5c14\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8d64\u9053\u9762\u5185\u65cb\u70ed\u70b9\u7684\u504f\u632f\u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u56db\u901f\u5ea6\u5256\u9762\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u65cf\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4eceCunningham\u76d8\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6700\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u5916\u56fa\u5b9a\u534a\u5f84\u8f68\u9053\uff0c\u8f68\u9053\u5185\u5760\u5165\u8fd0\u52a8\uff09\u5230\u7eaf\u5f84\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5185\u65cb\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ea7\u751f\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u504f\u632f\u65af\u6258\u514b\u65afQ-U\u73af\u6a21\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\u8fdb\u52a8\u3001\u89e3\u65cb\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u534a\u5f84\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u95ed\u5408Q-U\u73af\u5f62\u6210\u9c9c\u660e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u5f62\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u81ea\u65cb\u3001\u89c2\u6d4b\u8005\u503e\u89d2\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u548c\u672a\u6765\u5e72\u6d89\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u7ebf\u504f\u632f\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u7269\u8d28\u5185\u65cb\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5760\u5165\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

We propose a simple mechanism to introduce domain-specific physical knowledge into LLMs by fusing pre-trained latent physical features with a pre-trained language model. Our method employs a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework where a large LLM (teacher) generates synthetic question-answer supervision to transfer physical reasoning to a smaller LLM (student). The student is conditioned on latent physical features and trained via a lightweight adapter and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We demonstrate that this approach, applied to models with 1B, 8B, and 32B parameters, enables effective reasoning over real scientific data. Our models substantially outperform strong baselines, such as Gemini 3 Pro, across multiple downstream tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. We show that the model combines latent information with general physical understanding to predict complex properties and can be \"steered\" by identifying physically meaningful directions in the latent space. This allows for explicit physical manipulation and natural language interpretation of latent structures. While our experiments focus on astrophysics, the framework is domain-agnostic and applicable to various scientific fields. Our main contribution is a general framework for using LLMs as interpretable interfaces to scientific latent spaces, enabling a single model to perform diverse tasks through natural language guidance. This work marks a step toward developing scientifically capable and useful LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5165\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7269\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6570\u503c\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5165\u6a21\u578b", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e08\u751f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5927LLM\uff08\u6559\u5e08\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u7b54\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5c0fLLM\uff08\u5b66\u751f\uff09\u3002\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548cLoRA\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3", "result": "\u57281B\u30018B\u548c32B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8aGemini 3 Pro\u7b49\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u9884\u6d4b\u590d\u6742\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u5411\u8fdb\u884c\"\u5f15\u5bfc\"", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63a5\u53e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u5bfc\u6267\u884c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5411\u5f00\u53d1\u79d1\u5b66\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u5b9e\u7528LLM\u8fc8\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65"}}

Angular-momentum transfer from the accretion disk naturally spins up the WD, while the amplified internal magnetic field induces a non-axisymmetric deformation in presence of a misaligned rotation. Such WDs emits continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). We model the coupled evolutions of stellar mass, spin, and magnetic structure in accreting WDs in SSSs with \\texttt{MESA}, and compute the resulting quadrupolar deformation with the Einstein-Maxwell solver \\texttt{XNS}. We show that WDs in SSSs, particularly near the end ofthermal timescale mass transfer and close to the Chandrasekhar mass limit, produce CGWs predominantly in the deci-Hz band accessible to planned detectors such as DECIGO, BBO, Deci-Hz, ALIA, and LGWA, and are distinguishable from other Galactic CGW sources such as AM\\,CVn systems, detached double WDs, and isolated WDs. Well-studied SSSs such as CAL~83 and RX~J0019+2156 can be detectable, enabling targeted CGW measurements that directly probe WD's internal magnetic fields and rotation, while blind searches can reveal hundreds of obscured SSSs otherwise missed in soft X-rays and map the hidden population of accreting, rapidly rotating, magnetized WDs in nearby galaxies. A CGW detection from WDs in SSSs could also identify potential pre-explosion Type~Ia progenitors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8d85\u8f6fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6e90\u4e2d\u7684\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u901a\u8fc7\u5438\u79ef\u7ef4\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6838\u71c3\u70e7\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u8fde\u7eed\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\uff0c\u53ef\u5728deci-Hz\u9891\u6bb5\u88ab\u672a\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u8f6fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6e90\u4e2d\u5438\u79ef\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u7684Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MESA\u6a21\u62df\u5438\u79ef\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8026\u5408\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528XNS\u6c42\u89e3\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u9ea6\u514b\u65af\u97e6\u65b9\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u56db\u6781\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fde\u7eed\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8d85\u8f6fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6e90\u4e2d\u7684\u767d\u77ee\u661f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u70ed\u65f6\u6807\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u672b\u671f\u63a5\u8fd1\u94b1\u5fb7\u62c9\u585e\u5361\u6781\u9650\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5728deci-Hz\u9891\u6bb5\u4ea7\u751f\u8fde\u7eed\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\uff0c\u53ef\u88abDECIGO\u3001BBO\u7b49\u672a\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6e90\u533a\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d85\u8f6fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6e90\u4e2d\u7684\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u7814\u7a76\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u7684Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u3002"}}

Pollux will allow us to study stellar and (exo)planetary systems, as well as cosmic ecosystems. For example, Pollux will provide new insights on exoplanet formation and evolution, characterization of the atmospheres and magnetospheres of stars and planets, and star-planet interactions. It will also allow us to resolve narrow UV emission and absorption lines, enabling us to follow the baryon cycle over cosmic time -- from galaxies forming stars out of interstellar gas and grains, and planets forming in circumstellar disks, to the various forms of feedback into the interstellar and intergalactic medium -- and from active galactic nuclei. The most innovative characteristic of Pollux is its unique spectropolarimetric capability in the UV, which will open a new parameter space. Its very high spectral resolution (~70000 to ~100000) and stability over a very large wavelength range will also be a major asset. In this paper, we summarize the main scientific drivers of Pollux and present its current design, technological challenges, and the Pollux consortium organization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Pollux\u662f\u6b27\u6d32\u8054\u76df\u4e3aHWO\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u4eea\uff0c\u8986\u76d6100nm-1.8\u03bcm\u6ce2\u6bb5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u6052\u661f\u3001\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7814\u7a76\u6052\u661f\u548c\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u5b87\u5b99\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9700\u8981\u7d2b\u5916\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6f14\u5316\u3001\u5927\u6c14\u78c1\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u661f-\u884c\u661f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b87\u5b99\u91cd\u5b50\u5faa\u73af\u7b49\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u8986\u76d6100nm\u52301.8\u03bcm\u6ce2\u957f\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u4eea\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08\u7ea670000-100000\uff09\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7531\u6b27\u6d32\u8054\u76df\u5171\u540c\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Pollux\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u79d1\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u5f53\u524d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u4ee5\u53ca\u8054\u76df\u7ec4\u7ec7\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e3aHWO\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "Pollux\u4f5c\u4e3aHWO\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u4eea\uff0c\u51ed\u501f\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5bbd\u6ce2\u957f\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5c06\u4e3a\u6052\u661f\u3001\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u662f\u672a\u6765\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u6587\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The identical setup and observing procedure allow for direct, accurate measurements of morphological and kinematic changes over a seven-year baseline. We identified 263 compact knots in the 2020 image and, through comparison with the 2013 catalog of Koo et al. 2018 (arXiv:1809.07935), classified them into quasi-stationary circumstellar knots and fast-moving knots (FMKs) of supernova ejecta. The FMKs show significant flux fluctuations, and many of those detected in 2013 are absent in the 2020 image. Proper-motion measurements derived from cross-correlation analysis indicate that most FMKs follow nearly ballistic expansion, whereas some, particularly those just beyond the eastern Fe-rich, X-ray emitting ejecta region, exhibit noticeable deceleration. The proper motions of the main ejecta shell were also measured and modeled as a uniformly expanding shell with a systemic motion, which reproduces the observed geometric and kinematic asymmetries of the remnant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4ed9\u540e\u5ea7A\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff92013\u5e74\u548c2020\u5e74\u7a84\u5e26\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86263\u4e2a\u81f4\u5bc6\u7ed3\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ed3\u6709\u663e\u8457\u901a\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5448\u73b0\u51cf\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u4ed9\u540e\u5ea7A\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u5176\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u9057\u8ff9\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u6210\u5206\uff08\u51c6\u9759\u6b62\u73af\u5883\u7ed3\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ed3\uff09\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u6f14\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528UKIRT 3.8\u7c73\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u57282013\u5e74\u548c2020\u5e74\u83b7\u53d6\u76f8\u540c\u4eea\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u7a84\u5e26\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u8986\u76d6[Fe II] 1.644um + [Si I] 1.645um\u8c31\u7ebf\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u81f4\u5bc6\u7ed3\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u7ed3\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ed3\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u5747\u5300\u81a8\u80c0\u58f3\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86263\u4e2a\u81f4\u5bc6\u7ed3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ed3\u6709\u663e\u8457\u901a\u91cf\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a2013\u5e74\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u57282020\u5e74\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6d88\u5931\uff1b\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ed3\u9075\u5faa\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5f39\u9053\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u4f46\u4e1c\u90e8\u5bcc\u94c1X\u5c04\u7ebf\u53d1\u5c04\u533a\u5916\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u7ed3\u5448\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u51cf\u901f\uff1b\u4e3b\u629b\u5c04\u7269\u58f3\u5c42\u7684\u81ea\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\u663e\u793a\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ed9\u540e\u5ea7A\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ed3\u7684\u901a\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u51cf\u901f\u8868\u660e\u4e0e\u5468\u56f4\u4ecb\u8d28\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9057\u8ff9\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u81a8\u80c0\u6a21\u5f0f\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7206\u53d1\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53ca\u4e0e\u661f\u9645\u73af\u5883\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

In 2024 a major effort to improve the far-ultraviolet (FUV) geometric distortion, delta-geometric, and walk corrections was completed. Those three corrections occur early in the CalCOS workflow and shift photon events into the corrected reference frame ((XCORR, YCORR) coordinate system) in which subsequent calibration steps-and their reference files-are defined. This change necessitated the re-derivation of all \"downstream\" reference files in use at the time.

The line was detected 21.5 days (rest-frame) after an X-ray coronal flare observed in 2008 and it exhibits significant broadening consistent with relativistic reflection from the accretion disk in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). The line has a width of ~300 eV, corresponding to a Keplerian velocity of 14,000 km s-1, at a distance of 5-41 light-days from the SMBH, strongly implying that the observed coronal flare triggered the emergence of the line. This event provides rare direct evidence of the response of the accretion disk to impulsive coronal illumination and offers a new method to probe the SMBH and disk physics. The relativistic modeling favors a broadened line produced by distant reflection from an accretion disk around a rapidly spinning black hole viewed at an intermediate inclination, consistent with other observations. Systematic monitoring of type 1 AGN following strong X-ray flares may open a new observational window into the innermost regions of AGN, enabling constraints on the physics of SMBH and its accretion disk at different radii that are otherwise challenging to access.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838J1047+5907\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u77ac\u6001\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u94c1K\u03b1\u7ebf\uff0c\u8be5\u7ebf\u5728X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5195\u8000\u7206\u53d1\u540e21.5\u5929\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u5bf9\u5195\u8000\u8109\u51b2\u7167\u660e\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u4e2d\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u5195\u8000\u7206\u53d1\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u63a2\u6d4b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7269\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4bJ1047+5907\u57282008\u5e74X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5195\u8000\u7206\u53d1\u540e\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u94c1K\u03b1\u7ebf\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u7ebf\u5bbd\u3001\u7ea2\u79fb\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7ea6300 eV\u7684\u94c1K\u03b1\u7ebf\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e94\u5f00\u666e\u52d2\u901f\u5ea614,000 km/s\uff0c\u8ddd\u79bb\u9ed1\u6d1e5-41\u5149\u5929\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5195\u8000\u7206\u53d1\u89e6\u53d1\u4e86\u8be5\u7ebf\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e2d\u7b49\u503e\u89d2\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7684\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u53cd\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u5bf9\u8109\u51b2\u5195\u8000\u7167\u660e\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7f55\u89c1\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u6d4bI\u578b\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838X\u5c04\u7ebf\u8000\u6591\u6765\u63a2\u6d4bAGN\u6700\u5185\u533a\u7269\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\u3002"}}

We consider a host spacecraft that dispenses a small CubeSat, which acts as a test-mass. Both spacecraft perform approach maneuvers to target their flyby locations, with the host targeting a close proximity flyby and the CubeSat targeting a distant flyby. By incorporating short-range intersatellite measurements between the host and the CubeSat, the mass measurement sensitivity is substantially improved. We evaluate a set of proposed host and CubeSat hardware options against the 2023 and 2025 Planetary Defense Conference hypothetical threats, as well as a hypothetical flyby of 2024 YR4. These scenarios differ predominantly in their flyby speeds, which span from 1.7 to 22 km/s. Based on these scenarios, we demonstrate that a typical radio-frequency intersatellite measurement is ineffective for asteroids with diameters relevant to planetary defense (i.e., 50 - 500 m). However, we find that augmenting the system with a laser-based intersatellite ranging system or a high-precision Doppler system can enable mass measurements of asteroids as small as 100 m across all cases, and as small as 50 m for the slower (< 8 km/s) cases. The results are very sensitive to the timing of the final maneuver, which is used to target the low-altitude flyby point. This presents an operational challenge for the smallest objects, where optical detection times are comparatively late and the optical navigation targeting knowledge converges too slowly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91ca\u653e\u7acb\u65b9\u661f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e3b\u822a\u5929\u5668\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u98de\u8d8a\u4e0e\u5c0f\u536b\u661f\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u98de\u8d8a\u7ed3\u5408\u661f\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5371\u9669\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u5728\u884c\u661f\u9632\u5fa1\u5feb\u901f\u4fa6\u5bdf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u9669\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5a01\u80c1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u5236\u5b9a\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565", "method": "\u4e3b\u822a\u5929\u5668\u91ca\u653e\u7acb\u65b9\u661f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u5206\u522b\u6267\u884c\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u98de\u8d8a\u673a\u52a8\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u661f\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5c04\u9891\u3001\u6fc0\u5149\u6d4b\u8ddd\u6216\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u5f15\u529b\u5bf9\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5c04\u9891\u6d4b\u91cf\u5bf950-500\u7c73\u76f4\u5f84\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u6fc0\u5149\u6d4b\u8ddd\u6216\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4f7f100\u7c73\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u5728\u6240\u6709\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u53ef\u884c\uff0c50\u7c73\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u5728\u4f4e\u901f\uff08<8 km/s\uff09\u4e0b\u4e5f\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf", "conclusion": "\u6fc0\u5149\u6216\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u661f\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u7ec8\u673a\u52a8\u65f6\u673a\u5bf9\u6700\u5c0f\u5929\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u6784\u6210\u64cd\u4f5c\u6311\u6218"}}

As GECAM has the highest temporal resolution (0.1~$\u03bc$s) among instruments of its kind, it can identify the so-called simultaneous events (STE) that deposit signals in multiple detectors nearly at the same time (with a 0.3~$\u03bc$s window). However, the properties and origin of STE have not yet been explored. In this work, we implemented, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of the STE detected by GECAM, including their morphology, energy deposition, and the dependence on the geomagnetic coordinates. We find that these STE probably result from direct interactions between high-energy charged cosmic rays and satellite.

We investigate the timing and spectral properties of the Seyfert galaxy Mrk 110 using six XMM-Newton observations. A frequency-dependent lag analysis in the 7-9 $\\times 10^{-5}$ Hz range reveals a soft X-ray lag of 889-3000s in the combined 2019 data, detected with a significance of 80%. The cross-correlation function analysis, supported by simulations, also detects lags of similar nature. Spectral modeling performed by adopting both proposed black hole masses in the literature for Mrk 110 confirms the presence of a warm corona in all observations, along with a weak relativistic reflection component and the reflection fraction remains low (Rf < 1). Interpreting the measured soft lag in terms of light travel time implies an emission radius 4.5 Rg for a supermassive black hole mass of $M = 1.4 \\times 10^8$ solar mass , favoring a reflection scenario. However, if a lower mass of $M = 2 \\times 10^7$ solar mass is adopted, the inferred radius increases, and both relativistic reflection and warm Comptonization can plausibly contribute to the observed soft lag. The warm corona radius appears larger in the high accretion state and smaller in a lower accretion state, although no trend can be established. The persistently low reflection fraction suggests an outflowing inner corona in Mrk 110, consistent with the recent detection of jet activity in this source.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7XMM-Newton\u89c2\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76Mrk 110\u7684\u8f6fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u8d85\u91cf\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8f6fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6ede\u540e889-3000\u79d2\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53cd\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u6696\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u5316\u90fd\u53ef\u80fd\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u53cd\u5c04\u5206\u6570\u4f4e\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u5916\u6d41\u5185\u5195\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u4e2d\u8f6fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u8d85\u91cf\uff08\u4f4e\u4e8e2 keV\uff09\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u4e3b\u8981\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u91ca\uff1a\u5185\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u539a\u5195\u4e2d\u7684\u6696\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9Seyfert\u661f\u7cfbMrk 110\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u6f84\u6e05\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u516d\u6b21XMM-Newton\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u57287-9\u00d710\u207b\u2075 Hz\u9891\u7387\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6ede\u540e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u8c31\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u57282019\u5e74\u7ec4\u5408\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230889-3000\u79d2\u7684\u8f6fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6ede\u540e\uff08\u663e\u8457\u602780%\uff09\uff0c\u5149\u8c31\u5efa\u6a21\u786e\u8ba4\u6240\u6709\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u6696\u5195\u548c\u5f31\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u53cd\u5c04\u6210\u5206\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8eM=1.4\u00d710\u2078\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff0c\u53d1\u5c04\u534a\u5f84\u7ea64.5Rg\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53cd\u5c04\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8eM=2\u00d710\u2077\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u90fd\u53ef\u80fd\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u53cd\u5c04\u5206\u6570\u59cb\u7ec8\u8f83\u4f4e\uff08Rf<1\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6ede\u540e\u6d4b\u91cf\u652f\u6301\u53cd\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u6696\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u5316\u90fd\u53ef\u80fd\u8d77\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4f4e\u53cd\u5c04\u5206\u6570\u8868\u660eMrk 110\u5b58\u5728\u5916\u6d41\u5185\u5195\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u8be5\u6e90\u6700\u8fd1\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u55b7\u6d41\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

We describe the latest in-flight calibration of the Compton mode of the INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope, taking into account more than twenty years of data.

We operate the IBIS telescope as a Coded mask Compton telescope, using the Crab Nebula to refine the calibration, as is usually done for high-energy instruments. We have determined the spectroscopic and polarimetric properties of the IBIS Compton mode and their evolution along the entire duration of the mission. In addition, the long-term evolution of the Crab Nebula's polarization has been successfully measured and compared with other high-energy experiments. We could estimate the energy dependence of the Crab Nebula polarization in four bands between 200 keV and 1 MeV.

Two pairs of ears, a pair of blowouts in the north and south along the long axis of this SNR, and a pair of dents compose the point symmetric morphology. The fact that the symmetry axes of two pairs include pairs of opposite structural features in the inner ejecta implies that the shaping is by jets and not due to an interaction with an ambient material. While the JJEM predicts such morphologies, the competing neutrino-driven mechanism cannot account for point-symmetric morphologies. This study provides strong support for the claim that the JJEM is the primary CCSN explosion mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5927\u9ea6\u54f2\u4f26\u4e91\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9J0450.4-7050\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5177\u6709\u70b9\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u81f3\u5c11\u4e09\u5bf9\u55b7\u6d41\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\"\u6296\u52a8\u55b7\u6d41\"\u7206\u70b8\u673a\u5236\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7206\u70b8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7206\u70b8\u673a\u5236\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8981\u68c0\u9a8c\"\u6296\u52a8\u55b7\u6d41\u7206\u70b8\u673a\u5236\"\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\"\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\"\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5f62\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u5927\u9ea6\u54f2\u4f26\u4e91\u4e2d\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9J0450.4-7050\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7684\u8fd1\u671f\u53d1\u5e03\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u70b9\u5bf9\u79f0\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u5bf9\"\u8033\u6735\"\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5357\u5317\u8f74\u5411\u7684\u7206\u53d1\u5bf9\u4ee5\u53ca\u51f9\u9677\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0J0450.4-7050\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u70b9\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u81f3\u5c11\u4e09\u5bf9\u55b7\u6d41\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5bf9\u79f0\u8f74\u4e0a\u7684\u76f8\u53cd\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u660e\u5f62\u6001\u662f\u7531\u55b7\u6d41\u5851\u9020\u800c\u975e\u73af\u5883\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u70b9\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f62\u6001\u7b26\u5408\u6296\u52a8\u55b7\u6d41\u7206\u70b8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6296\u52a8\u55b7\u6d41\u7206\u70b8\u673a\u5236\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7206\u70b8\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u70b9\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f62\u6001\u53ea\u80fd\u7531\u55b7\u6d41\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u6b64\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}
