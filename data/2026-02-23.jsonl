In this Letter, we present the first relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a surface shear-driven magnetar eruption, capturing reconnection-driven plasma heating, the ejection of relativistically hot plasma, and the formation of a hot fireball confined within the inner magnetosphere. We find that magnetic reconnection in the equatorial current sheet launches a hot trailing outflow capable of powering the initial spike observed in giant flares, while simultaneously leaving behind a thermally stratified fireball with sufficient thermal energy to produce the pulsating, decaying tail. Together, these features provide a self-consistent physical framework for understanding the observed energetics of magnetar giant flares. The eruption also expels a magnetically dominated giant plasmoid carrying up to $\\sim 9\\%$ of the magnetosphere's total magnetic energy. Furthermore, our simulation demonstrates how the plasmoid drives the formation of a blast wave -- an important ingredient in models linking magnetar eruptions to fast radio bursts."}

Appendices add 21 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables", "summary": "We perform a comprehensive analysis of cosmic-ray propagation using the time-dependent AMS-02 flux measurements covering a full solar cycle, with particular emphasis on the role of solar modulation. We fit two representative Galactic propagation scenarios, convection- and re-acceleration-dominated models, in combination with three solar modulation prescriptions: the standard force-field approximation, an extended force-field model with a rigidity break, and the heliospheric propagation code $\\texttt{HelMod}$. The inclusion of time-resolved antiproton data provides a unique probe of charge-sign-dependent modulation effects and low-energy systematics. We find that the force-field approximation can describe positively charged nuclei reasonably well outside the solar maximum in convection-dominated models, but fails during periods of high solar activity and for antiprotons at all times. In re-acceleration scenarios, strong degeneracies between solar modulation and low-energy propagation lead to unphysical results when simple modulation models are employed. Across all models, we identify systematic uncertainties of order 10-15% in the reconstructed local interstellar spectra and propagation parameters, driven by limitations in current solar modulation modelling. Compared to the percent level error of current measurements, these uncertainties significantly limit the precision of cosmic-ray studies. Future time-dependent measurements spanning a full 22-year solar cycle will be crucial to reduce these uncertainties."}

While static EoS models are increasingly well-constrained by observations of binary neutron star (BNS) inspirals, the possibility of a dynamic phase transition occurring during the coalescence has been thus far deferred from standard gravitational-wave (GW) analyses. In this work, we investigate the detectability of such a phase transition, manifesting as a macroscopic shift in the tidal deformability parameter $Λ$, using GWs from Neutron Star-Black Hole (NSBH) coalescences. We argue that NSBH systems serve as a cleaner laboratory for this phenomenology than BNS systems due to the absence of the $\\tildeΛ(Λ_1,Λ_2)$ degeneracy, allowing for the isolation of single-body tidal evolution. We introduce a phenomenological waveform model, TROYE (Transitional Representation Of varYing Equation-of-state), which stitches together two waveform approximants in the time domain to simulate a smooth but rapid transition between two equations of state during the late inspiral. We perform a comprehensive Bayesian injection and recovery campaign on 100 simulated events using the bilby inference library. Our results demonstrate that a phase transition corresponding to a tidal shift of $|ΔΛ| \\gtrsim 400$ is detectable with Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, yielding decisive statistical evidence ($\\ln B > 5$). We further identify a \"V-shape\" asymmetry in detectability, where \"softening\" transitions (decreasing $Λ$) are systematically easier to detect than \"stiffening\" ones due to the specific phase evolution of the tidal sector. Finally, we present \"stress tests\" showing that the transition remains recoverable even when marginalized over uncertainties in the stitching time and binary mass ratio."}

Such analyses require fast and accurate mappings between the moments of $X_{\\rm max}$ and those of the logarithmic mass, $\\ln A$, based on realistic air-shower simulations. In this work we provide updated parametrizations of the $X_{\\rm max}$ moments and distributions for air showers initiated by nuclei from proton to iron, simulated with CONEX for three state-of-the-art hadronic interaction models: Epos LHC-R, Sibyll 2.3e, and QGSJet-III-01. We parametrize the mean depth $\\langle X_{\\rm max}\\rangle$ and the variance $σ^2(X_{\\rm max})$ as functions of energy and mass. For the variance we compare a second-order polynomial model with an exponential model. In addition, we model the full $X_{\\rm max}$ distributions with a three-parameter generalized Gumbel function. The Gumbel parameters are fitted using an unbinned likelihood and are validated by comparing the implied mean and variance with the raw CONEX samples and with the moment parametrizations. Across the full energy range considered, residuals between the parametrizations (or the Gumbel representation) and the simulations are at the level of a few g cm$^{-2}$ for the mean and a few (g cm$^{-2}$)$^2$ for the variance, making these parametrizations suitable for precision UHECR composition studies and forward-folding analyses of $X_{\\rm max}$ distributions."}

If correct, this would imply that technosignatures may already have reached Earth without being detected or correctly identified. Here, we explore this possibility using a Bayesian inference framework to estimate present-day detectability given $n\\ge 1$ undetected contacts over the past 65 years -- the period since the first SETI experiment. We show that achieving high detectability of technosignatures emitted within a few hundred light-years of Earth would require implausibly large $n$ values, even exceeding the population of habitable planets within that range. More conservative estimates can be obtained only assuming that emitters are tightly clustered near Earth or that their population in the Milky Way has undergone a very recent and sudden boost. This tension is further exacerbated for short-lived technosignatures and persists whether they are omnidirectional, as in Dysonian megastructures, or directional, as in intentional communication attempts. These findings suggest that, if undetected past contacts from the Milky Way have indeed occurred, the best prospects of detection may lie in searches extending over several thousand light-years, though only a few detectable technoemissions would be expected."}

It is an artefact of our ignorance of the properties of matter at supra-nuclear densities, which exist in the cores of neutron stars. The study addresses these problems with a physics-informed machine learning approach, guided by astrophysical observations. The Transformer model is trained on an agnostically generated ensemble of equations of state. Two geometric parameters are defined on the mass-radius sequence of a neutron star--the front bending and the back bending. The transformer provides a two-step solution: first, the model predicts the maximum mass and radius using the bending parameters. Second, it predicts the square of the sound speed profile, completing the inverse mapping. The prediction is that massive neutron stars form when the sound speed peaks at low density, leading to strong back-bending and an early phase transition to quark matter. Massive stars favour a stiff equation of state at low density, and the density of matter at the star's core is sufficiently small. The maximum mass for a neutron star predicted by the astrophysical constrained transformer model is $2.477$ solar masses, and a minimum radius of about $11.498$ km for a neutron star of $1.4$ solar masses."}

We demonstrate that this approach is sensitive to features with mean brightness significantly below the background noise level, and it is resistant to the influence of bright astronomical sources (e.g., stars, galaxies) in most cases. Comparing with a set of satellite trails identified by eye, we find a trail recovery rate of 85\\% and a false detection rate (after removing diffraction spikes that are easily filtered) of 2.5\\%. By performing an analysis using a much larger ACS/WFC data set where false trails are identified by their persistence across multiple images of the same field, we identify the Radon Transform parameter space and image properties where our algorithm is unreliable, and estimate a false detection rate of $\\sim10\\%$ elsewhere. We apply our method to ACS/WFC data taken between 2002 and 2022 to determine both the frequency of satellite trail contamination in science data and also the typical trail brightness as a function of time. We find the rate of satellite trail contamination has increased by approximately a factor of two in the last two decades, but there is no clear systematic evolution in the typical trail brightness. Our satellite trail identification program is available as part of the \\texttt{acstools} package."}

However, the evolution of the cold clumps has not been investigated in detail yet. In this paper, we conduct hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the evolution of the cold clumps. In addition to previous result that when the accretion rate is high enough the cold clumps emerge within the hot accretion flow, we found that instead of directly moving toward to the black hole, the clumps moves outward when they initially form. The reason should be the combination of viscous torque and the condensation of hot gas from larger radii, which lead to the slightly super-Keplerian angular momentum of the clumps. After reaching the equilibrium position, the clumps begin to fragment at the inner edge with each fragment moving inward sequentially. Generally, the azimuthal movement of the clumps are quasi-Keplerian, being closer to the outer detached Keplerian cold disk rather than the surrounding sub-Keplerian hot accretion flow, which agrees well with the semi-analytical results for weak coupling case in Wang et al. (2012)."}

Using Zwicky Transient Facility alerts as a proxy for Rubin, we demonstrate the system in use in cases where Euclid did and did not detect the transient and highlight the value that can be added in each case. For transients detected by Euclid these benefits include identifying the supernovae (SNe) in observations taken prior to ground-based detection, thereby better constraining the explosion time, such as SN 2024pvw detected ~3 d prior to ground based detections.

LISA's interferometers must deliver pm/rtHz sensitivity while accommodating beam tilts up to 1 mrad at the photodiodes, which degrade the interferometric amplitude and increase the induced readout noise coupling. This paper uses an analytical framework developed by the authors in a previous work, based on minimal and justified approximations, that relates beam tilt to the resulting heterodyne signal amplitude in a generic two-beam interferometer with circular-area photodiodes (PDs). A set of interferometric topologies is analyzed, all of high relevance for LISA. We derive the exact amplitude response for an infinite detector and a closed-form approximation for finite detectors, and we validate both against numerical simulations and experimental measurements on an ultra-stable LISA-representative testbed. We then use this model to quantify the phase-noise amplification arising from reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under tilt, showing that curvature mismatches between the interfering beams substantially enhance this effect. Finally, we introduce a compact function that captures the angular dependence of correlated and uncorrelated phase noises in quadrant photodiode (QPD)-based readouts. Here, a new noise feature, caused by wavefront curvature mismatch, is predicted and measured for the first time. These results indicate that controlling wavefront curvature mismatch in the test mass interferometer (TMI) is essential to limit excess phase noise. The models and results derived in this paper, although originating in the context of LISA, are general and can be applied to any interferometric topology undergoing tilts with pivot on the detector plane."}

As part of the Colombian Antarctic Telescopes for 21 cm Absorption during Reionization (CANTAR) initiative, we present a simulation and analysis framework to evaluate antenna chromaticity, optimize instrument design, and assess site suitability for global 21 cm experiments. Using frequency-dependent beam models and Haslam-based sky maps, we compute dynamic spectra for the EDGES blade dipole and a set of dipole and novel monopole antennas optimized via particle swarm optimization. The optimized designs exhibit improved spectral smoothness compared to EDGES, particularly in the 70-120 MHz range. We also evaluate latitude-dependent sky brightness and identify mid-latitude sites (-40° to +5°) as optimal for foreground suppression. We apply Bayesian inference together with posterior predictive model validation to the publicly released EDGES data, assessing statistical consistency rather than hypothesis testing or model comparison. We find that physically motivated foreground and ionospheric models are statistically consistent with the data only when a 21 cm absorption feature is excluded. From the validated posterior, we generate a statistically validated ensemble of foreground corrections for use in beam-sky simulations. These results support a two-phase strategy for CANTAR: Antarctic deployments for calibration and testing, and future science operations at mid-latitude sites. Our framework provides a validated path toward robust foreground modeling, antenna design, and systematics control for global 21 cm signal detection."}
