Since systematics are often poorly understood and difficult to model, removing them directly and entirely may not be feasible. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that aligns learned features between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples by optimizing a feature-alignment loss on the representations extracted from a pre-trained ID model. We first experimentally validate the method on the MNIST dataset using possible alignment losses, including mean squared error and optimal transport, and subsequently apply it to large-scale maps of neutral hydrogen. Our results show that optimal transport is particularly effective at aligning OOD features when parity between ID and OOD samples is unknown, even with limited data-mimicking real-world conditions in extracting information from large-scale surveys.

Submitted to PASP", "summary": "Ground-based astronomy suffers from strong atmospheric line- and thermal continuum emission, at the near infrared (NIR, 0.7-1.1$\u03bc$m), and short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1.1-2.5$\u03bc$m) wavelengths. The thermal continuum emission increases exponentially towards the red sensitivity cutoff of the state-of-the-art 2.5$\u03bc$m cutoff SWIR detectors. Given availability of an optical quality shortpass filter material with strong blocking density in the SWIR, lower cost instrumentation, and higher performance filters could be designed. We demonstrate monopotassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP, chemical formula KH$_2$PO$_4$) as a strong candidate for this purpose. KDP is fully transparent at wavelengths from ultraviolet to 1.3$\u03bc$m, but becomes highly opaque at wavelengths >2$\u03bc$m. We demonstrate on-sky use of KDP by improving performance of a cryogenic broadband filter with known off-band thermal leak, and using a non-cryogenic narrow band filter for deep observation. KDP reduces the sky background by 4.5 magnitudes in the leaky Z-band filter we use. Our 4nm wide, central wavelength 1.191$\u03bc$m narrowband filter in combination with KDP reduces the sky surface brightness by three magnitudes compared to a J broadband. We find a sky surface brightness of 18.5mag arcsec$^{-2}$ at 1.191$\u03bc$m, and interpret it as the airglow continuum. KDP is an excellent thermal blocker, when its temperature is maintained above its Curie point at 123K.

We consider the number of citations to papers using the software and the number of person-days from their git repositories, as proxies for impact and complexity, respectively.

It was launched in August 2019 and it is operating since October 2019 being located in the Russian section (Zvezda module) of the station and viewing our planet from a nadir-facing UV-transparent window. The instrument is based on the concept of the original JEM-EUSO mission and consists of an optical system employing two Fresnel lenses of 25 cm each and a focal surface composed of 36 Multi-Anode Photomultiplier tubes, 64 channels each, for a total of 2304 channels with single photon counting sensitivity and an overall field of view of 44$^\\circ \\times $44$^\\circ$. Mini-EUSO can map the night-time Earth in the near UV range (predominantly between 290 nm and 430 nm), with a spatial resolution of about 6~km and different temporal resolutions of 2.5~$\u03bc$s, 320~$\u03bc$s and 41 ms. Mini-EUSO observations are extremely important to better assess the potential of a space-based detector in studying Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) such as K-EUSO and POEMMA. In this contribution we focus the attention on the results of the UV measurements and we place them in the context of UHECR observations from space, namely the estimation of exposure for the planned M-EUSO (Multi-messenger Extreme Universe Space Observatory) mission.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mini-EUSO\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ad9\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u7684JEM-EUSO\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7UV\u900f\u660e\u7a97\u53e3\u89c2\u6d4b\u5730\u7403\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u9ad8\u80fd\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u9ad8\u80fd\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u5212\u4e2d\u7684M-EUSO\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u66dd\u5149\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a25\u5398\u7c73\u83f2\u6d85\u5c14\u900f\u955c\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u753136\u4e2a\u591a\u9633\u6781\u5149\u7535\u500d\u589e\u7ba1\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u7126\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u5728\u8fd1\u7d2b\u5916\u6ce2\u6bb5\uff08290-430 nm\uff09\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff082.5\u03bcs\u3001320\u03bcs\u548c41 ms\uff09\u89c2\u6d4b\u591c\u95f4\u5730\u7403\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u83b7\u53d6\u4e86\u5730\u7403\u7684UV\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3a6\u516c\u91cc\uff0c\u4e3aUHECR\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "Mini-EUSO\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u57faUHECR\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e3aM-EUSO\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "We present long-term three-dimensional (3D) simulations of Type-IIP supernovae (SNe) for 13 non-rotating, single-star, red-supergiant (RSG) progenitors with zero-age-main-sequence masses between 12.5 M$_{\\odot}$ and 27.3 M$_{\\odot}$. The explosions were modelled with a parametric treatment of neutrino heating to obtain defined energies, ${}^{56}$Ni yields, and neutron-star properties in agreement with previous results. Our 3D SN models were evolved from core bounce until 10 days to study how the large-scale mixing of chemical elements depends on the progenitor structure. Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (RTIs), which grow at the (C+O)/He and He/H interfaces and interact with the reverse shock forming after the SN shock has passed the He/H interface, play a crucial role in the outward mixing of ${}^{56}$Ni into the hydrogen envelope. We find most extreme ${}^{56}$Ni mixing and the highest maximum ${}^{56}$Ni velocities in lower-mass (LM) explosions despite lower explosion energies, and the weakest ${}^{56}$Ni mixing in the 3D explosions of the most massive RSGs. The efficiency of radial ${}^{56}$Ni mixing anti-correlates linearly with the helium-core mass and correlates positively with the magnitude of a local maximum of $\u03c1r^3$ in the helium shell. This maximum causes shock deceleration and therefore facilitates high growth factors of RTI at the (C+O)/He interface in the LM explosions. Therefore fast-moving ${}^{56}$Ni created by the asymmetric neutrino-heating mechanism is carried into the ubiquitous RT-unstable region near the He/H interface and ultimately far into the envelopes of the exploding RSGs. Our correlations may aid improving mixing prescriptions in 1D SN models and deducing progenitor structures from observed SN properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf913\u4e2a\u975e\u65cb\u8f6c\u5355\u661f\u7ea2\u8d85\u5de8\u661f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u957f\u671f3D\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76IIP\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u4e2d\u5316\u5b66\u5143\u7d20\u6df7\u5408\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Ni-56\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6c26\u6838\u8d28\u91cf\u5448\u53cd\u6bd4\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5316\u5b66\u5143\u7d20\u6df7\u5408\u5982\u4f55\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fNi-56\u5411\u5916\u6df7\u5408\u5230\u6c22\u5305\u5c42\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u52a0\u70ed\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df13\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u7ea2\u8d85\u5de8\u661f\u76843D\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7206\u70b8\uff0c\u4ece\u6838\u5fc3\u53cd\u5f39\u6f14\u5316\u523010\u5929\u540e\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u7206\u70b8\u4e2dNi-56\u6df7\u5408\u6700\u6781\u7aef\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u91cd\u7ea2\u8d85\u5de8\u661f\u76843D\u7206\u70b8\u4e2dNi-56\u6df7\u5408\u6700\u5f31\u3002Ni-56\u5f84\u5411\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6c26\u6838\u8d28\u91cf\u5448\u53cd\u6bd4\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u745e\u5229-\u6cf0\u52d2\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5728Ni-56\u6df7\u5408\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb1D\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5904\u65b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u8d28\u63a8\u65ad\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

The analysis of bright X-ray sources is complicated by so-called pile-up, which results from high incident photon flux. This nonlinear effect distorts the measured spectrum, resulting in biases in the inferred physical parameters, and can even lead to a complete signal loss in extreme cases. Piled-up data are commonly discarded due to resulting intractability of the likelihood. As a result, a large number of archival observations remain underexplored. We present a machine learning solution to this problem, using a simulation-based inference framework that allows us to estimate posterior distributions of physical source parameters from piled-up eROSITA data. We show that a normalizing flow produces better-constrained posterior densities than traditional mitigation techniques, as more data can be leveraged. We consider model- and calibration-dependent uncertainties and the applicability of such an algorithm to real data in the eROSITA archive.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5929\u6587\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5806\u79ef\u6548\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5806\u79ef\u7684eROSITA\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u6e90\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "X\u5c04\u7ebf\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9ad8\u6d41\u91cf\u6e90\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5806\u79ef\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5149\u8c31\u5931\u771f\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e22\u5f03\u5806\u79ef\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u6863\u6848\u89c2\u6d4b\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u4ece\u5806\u79ef\u7684eROSITA\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u6e90\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u597d\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8eeROSITA\u6863\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u5806\u79ef\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Most models rely on analytical formulae for the disk mass and dynamical ejecta that are fitted to the results of numerical simulations, yet these fits have large uncertainties that significantly limit our ability to extract information from merger observations. In a recent manuscript, Darc et al claim that disk mass formulae constructed using symbolic regression outperform existing formulae and robustly extend to regions of the parameter space outside of the fitting region. I show here that the improvement over the most directly comparable existing model comes mostly from the use of different error measures in optimizing the fitting parameters. For the limited training data used so far, that existing fitting formula has a performance similar to symbolic regression models when optimized over the same error measure. More importantly, I show that many of the formulae obtained through symbolic regression provide unphysical results when used over the whole range of parameters relevant to the modeling of binary neutron star mergers, making them dangerous to use within parameter estimation pipelines. I conclude that fitting formulae with more physics input (e.g. Lund et al 2025), albeit certainly imperfect, remain safer to use in data analysis than these symbolic regression results. Symbolic regression results used in conjunction with careful physics-based vetting may however outperform them in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8d28\u7591\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5408\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4e14\u8bb8\u591a\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u516c\u5f0f\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5916\u7ed9\u51fa\u975e\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u9020\u6210\u5371\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5408\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u4f18\u5316\u73b0\u6709\u62df\u5408\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u516c\u5f0f\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff1b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8bef\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u62df\u5408\u516c\u5f0f\u8868\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff1b\u8bb8\u591a\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u516c\u5f0f\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5916\u7ed9\u51fa\u975e\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7269\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u62df\u5408\u516c\u5f0f\u867d\u7136\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6bd4\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\uff1b\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u7ed3\u679c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u4ed4\u7ec6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u624d\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u672a\u6765\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Serving as a precursor to the planned POEMMA satellite mission, PBR will be launched aboard a NASA Super Pressure Balloon for a flight at of 33 km altitude in Spring 2027 from Wanaka, New Zealand. The unique conditions of low pressure and high altitude will enable in-situ observations of High-Altitude Horizontal Air Showers (HAHAs), a poorly understood class of nearly horizontal Extensive Air Showers induced by cosmic rays skimming the Earth's atmosphere without reaching the ground. Due to the lower atmospheric grammage at these altitudes, HAHAs develop more gradually compared to typical downward-going EASs, with interaction lengths on the order of 100 km. This slow development allows balloon-borne instruments to probe the early stages of cosmic ray shower evolution. At these early stages, high-energy electrons and positrons from the electromagnetic component of the shower can generate X-rays and gamma rays via synchrotron radiation. The X-$\u03b3$ detector onboard PBR is designed to measure these photons across a broad energy range. The instrument consists of four sub-detectors, each optimized for different overlapping energy bandfrom tens of keV to MeV. The current design utilizes CsI(Tl)/NaI(Tl) scintillating crystals coupled with SiPMs for photon detection. To suppress background noise, the detectors are enclosed within an anti-coincidence system to reject charged particle events. The X-$\u03b3$ detector is aligned with PBR's primary instruments, the Fluorescence Camera and the Cherenkov Camera, within a 30$^\\circ$ field of view, overlapping with both imaging cameras. It will operate in a triggered mode, with the possibility to receive signals from the other instruments to check for simultaneous events.", "AI": {"tldr": "POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) \u662f\u4e00\u4e2aNASA\u6c14\u7403\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u9ad8\u80fd\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u751a\u9ad8\u80fd\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u3002\u5b83\u4f5c\u4e3aPOEMMA\u536b\u661f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5148\u5bfc\uff0c\u5c06\u57282027\u5e74\u4ece\u65b0\u897f\u5170\u74e6\u7eb3\u5361\u53d1\u5c04\u523033\u516c\u91cc\u9ad8\u7a7a\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u9ad8\u6d77\u62d4\u6c34\u5e73\u7a7a\u6c14\u7c07\u5c04(HAHAs)\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u9ad8\u80fd\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u751a\u9ad8\u80fd\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u89c2\u6d4b\u9ad8\u6d77\u62d4\u6c34\u5e73\u7a7a\u6c14\u7c07\u5c04(HAHAs)\uff0c\u8fd9\u7c7b\u7c07\u5c04\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u6c14\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f4e\u800c\u53d1\u5c55\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u4f7f\u6c14\u7403\u4eea\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u63a2\u6d4b\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u7c07\u5c04\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6c14\u7403\u5e73\u53f0\u642d\u8f7dX-\u03b3\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u5b50\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4ece\u51e0\u5341keV\u5230MeV\u7684\u5bbd\u80fd\u533a\u3002\u91c7\u7528CsI(Tl)/NaI(Tl)\u95ea\u70c1\u6676\u4f53\u4e0eSiPMs\u8026\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u5b50\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u5907\u53cd\u7b26\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u6291\u5236\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u4e0e\u8367\u5149\u76f8\u673a\u548c\u5207\u4f26\u79d1\u592b\u76f8\u673a\u572830\u00b0\u89c6\u573a\u5185\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u8ba1\u5212\u4e8e2027\u5e74\u6625\u5b63\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u5c06\u9996\u6b21\u572833\u516c\u91cc\u9ad8\u7a7a\u5bf9HAHAs\u8fdb\u884c\u539f\u4f4d\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u63a2\u6d4b\u7c07\u5c04\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u9ad8\u80fd\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u4ea7\u751f\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "PBR\u4f5c\u4e3aPOEMMA\u536b\u661f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5148\u5bfc\uff0c\u5c06\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u9ad8\u80fd\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u751a\u9ad8\u80fd\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4bHAHAs\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u589e\u8fdb\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u7269\u7406\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Using a modular back-tracing framework, we explore a set of widely used magnetic-field descriptions - from a Parker spiral baseline to more structured configurations that include latitudinal wind contrasts, Smith-Bieber-type azimuthal strengthening, and tilted or wavy heliospheric current sheets. Across these models the picture is consistent: most bending is accumulated within the inner tens of astronomical units and decreases rapidly with energy. Field choices and solar-cycle geometry set the overall normalization, with stronger spiral winding or a more highly tilted current sheet producing larger deflections at the same energy. Differences between electrons and positrons are most apparent at lower energies, where drift histories and current-sheet encounters diverge, and become increasingly small at multi-TeV energies. We summarize these trends with a practical threshold energy describing when heliospheric bending falls below an instrument's angular resolution, and we verify that our conclusions are robust to numerical settings. For current instruments, heliospheric effects can usually be treated as a small correction at the highest energies, while sub-TeV analyses benefit from a calibrated envelope that accounts for plausible field configurations during the observing epoch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65e5\u7403\u5c42\u5bf9\u9ad8\u80fd\u5b87\u5b99\u7ebf\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u5230\u8fbe\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u504f\u8f6c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9608\u503c\u80fd\u91cf\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ffd\u7565\u65e5\u7403\u5c42\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u78c1\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e5\u7403\u5c42\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u9ad8\u80fd\u5b87\u5b99\u7ebf\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u7684\u5230\u8fbe\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ffd\u7565\u8fd9\u79cd\"\u65e5\u7403\u5c42\u900f\u955c\"\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b87\u5b99\u7ebf\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u6e90\u5173\u8054\u7814\u7a76\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8003\u8651\u5230\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u7ebf\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u5206\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u672a\u77e5\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u56de\u6eaf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u7ec4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ece\u5e15\u514b\u87ba\u65cb\u57fa\u7ebf\u5230\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7eac\u5ea6\u98ce\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3001Smith-Bieber\u578b\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee5\u53ca\u503e\u659c\u6216\u6ce2\u6d6a\u72b6\u7684\u65e5\u7403\u5c42\u7535\u6d41\u7247\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u663e\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u504f\u8f6c\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u6570\u5341\u5929\u6587\u5355\u4f4d\u5185\uff0c\u5e76\u968f\u80fd\u91cf\u5feb\u901f\u51cf\u5c0f\u3002\u78c1\u573a\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u592a\u9633\u5468\u671f\u51e0\u4f55\u8bbe\u5b9a\u6574\u4f53\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u87ba\u65cb\u7f20\u7ed5\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\u503e\u659c\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u7247\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u504f\u8f6c\u3002\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0b\u6700\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u5728\u6570TeV\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0b\u53d8\u5f97\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u4eea\u5668\uff0c\u65e5\u7403\u5c42\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u6700\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0b\u901a\u5e38\u53ef\u4ee5\u89c6\u4e3a\u5c0f\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u800c\u4e9aTeV\u5206\u6790\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u8003\u8651\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u671f\u5408\u7406\u78c1\u573a\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u5305\u7edc\u3002"}}

About 80 SNe Ibn have been discovered to date, and only a handful have extensive observational records. Thus, many open questions regarding the progenitor system and the origin of the CSM remain. Here we investigate potential correlations between the spectral features of the prominent He I $\u03bb$5876 line and the optical and X-ray light curve properties of SNe Ibn. We compile the largest sample of 61 SNe Ibn to date, of which 24 SNe have photometric and spectroscopic data from the Young Supernova Experiment and 37 SNe have archival data sets. We fit 24 SNe Ibn with sufficient photometric coverage ($B$ to $z$ bands) using semi-analytical models from MOSFiT. We demonstrate that the light curves of SNe Ibn are more diverse than previous analyses suggest, with absolute $r$-band peak magnitudes of $-19.4\\pm0.6$~mag and rise (from $-10$ days to peak) and decay-rates (from peak to +10 days) of $-0.08\\pm0.06$ and $0.08\\pm0.03$ mag/day, respectively. We find that the majority of SNe Ibn in the sub-sample are consistent with a low-energy explosion ($<10^{51}$ erg) of a star with a compact envelope surrounded by $\\sim$0.1 M$_{\\odot}$ of helium-rich CSM. The inferred ejecta masses are small ($\\sim 1$ M$_{\\odot}$) and expand with a velocity of $\\sim$5000 km/s. Our spectroscopic analysis shows that the mean velocity of the narrow component of the He I lines, associated to the CSM, peaks at $\\sim1100$ km/s. The mean CSM and ejecta masses inferred for a sub-sample of SNe Ibn indicate that their progenitors are not massive ($\\sim10$ M$_{\\odot}$), single stars at the moment of explosion, but are likely binary systems. This agrees with the detection of potential companion stars of SNe Ibn progenitors, and the inferred CSM properties from stellar evolution models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e8661\u4e2aIbn\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u6027\u8d28\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7684\u66f4\u52a0\u591a\u6837\u5316\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u7b26\u5408\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u7206\u70b8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u8d28\u91cf\u7ea610\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "Ibn\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u6765\u81ea\u672a\u6fc0\u6ce2\u661f\u9645\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u7a84\u6c26\u7ebf\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u4ec5\u53d1\u73b0\u7ea680\u4e2a\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u6570\u6709\u8be6\u7ec6\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\u5173\u4e8e\u5176\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u661f\u9645\u7269\u8d28\u8d77\u6e90\u4ecd\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u672a\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e86\u8fc4\u4eca\u6700\u5927\u768461\u4e2aIbn\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d24\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u5e74\u8f7b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9879\u76ee\uff0c37\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u6863\u6848\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4f7f\u7528MOSFiT\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u540824\u4e2a\u6709\u5145\u5206\u6d4b\u5149\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "Ibn\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684r\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5cf0\u503c\u661f\u7b49\u4e3a-19.4\u00b10.6\u7b49\uff0c\u4e0a\u5347\u548c\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a-0.08\u00b10.06\u548c0.08\u00b10.03\u7b49/\u5929\u3002\u591a\u6570\u6837\u672c\u7b26\u5408\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u7206\u70b8(<10^51 erg)\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u629b\u5c04\u7269\u8d28\u91cf\u7ea61\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u81a8\u80c0\u901f\u5ea6\u7ea65000 km/s\u3002\u6c26\u7ebf\u7a84\u6210\u5206\u5e73\u5747\u901f\u5ea6\u7ea61100 km/s\u3002", "conclusion": "Ibn\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u4e0d\u662f\u7206\u70b8\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u5355\u661f\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u8d28\u91cf\u7ea610\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f34\u661f\u548c\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u661f\u9645\u7269\u8d28\u6027\u8d28\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

Among the five instruments onboard the CSST, the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) offers the unique ability to simultaneously capture spatial and spectral information across a field of view of no less than $6^{''}\\times6^{''}$. Key advantages of the IFS include a high spatial resolution of $0.2^{''}$ and a broad spectral coverage from 350 to 1000 nm, making it an ideal instrument for studying physical processes in the vicinity of supermassive black holes within galaxies. To more accurately assess the technical and scientific performance of the CSST-IFS, it is essential to develop a simulation tool that incorporates realistic effects from all optical components. Such a simulation will form an integral part of the CSST-IFS data and pipeline system, enabling the development of the data reduction pipeline well ahead of actual observations. This paper presents an end-to-end simulation workflow for the CSST-IFS, incorporating a wide range of instrumental effects that may influence its spectral and imaging performance. The simulation accounts for optical diffraction effects introduced by all components, such as image slicers and slit array, as well as sub-pixel effects from gratings.

Broadband 3-79 keV spectroscopy employs a physically motivated model combining a cool truncated disk (\\texttt{diskbb}), relativistic reflection (\\texttt{relxill} in reflection-only mode), and Comptonized continuum (\\texttt{nthComp}) to probe the inner accretion geometry around a rapidly spinning black hole ($a_\\ast\\!=\\!0.98$) at moderate inclination. Simultaneous timing analysis reveals type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with novel coherence evolution: the quality factor ($Q$) exhibits a striking non-monotonic dependence on both QPO frequency and luminosity, peaking near $\u03bd_{\\rm QPO}\\!\\sim\\!1.2$~Hz and declining at both lower and higher frequencies. This turnover directly constrains Lense-Thirring precession geometry, implying optimal coherence at intermediate truncation radius. A tight photon-index-QPO-frequency correlation demonstrates that spectral softening and frequency rise are concurrent signatures of inward truncation-radius motion. The triadic luminosity evolution-rising disk and Compton, declining reflection-traces precession-driven geometry changes and corona beaming effects. Interpreting disk-normalization variability as apparent-area changes rather than physical radius swings provides new insight into disk-corona boundary layers.

To be published in Advances in Space Research", "summary": "In this work we investigate the potential of a thermal infrared (IR) space telescope to remotely characterize the component temperatures of a satellite. With the rapid increase in the number of objects launched in recent years, the ability to detect, track, identify and determine the intent of satellites has become of increasing importance. Spectral modeling of satellites from multi-wavelength photometry in the thermal IR is a technique that has the potential to derive information about the temperature and operational status of a satellite in orbit, without the requirement to spatially resolve the target. Previous work has focused on determination of a single/effective temperature for a Resident Space Objects (RSOs) - such as satellites, asteroids, debris and rocket bodies - from remote observations, obtaining mixed results in terms of ability to classify objects. To progress, we explore a two-greybody component spectral model. Using this analytical model, we investigate which temperature characteristics may be identified from unresolved multi-wavelength photometric observations as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, under the assumption of Poisson noise-dominated data. With this instrument-agnostic framework, we then quantify the potential of this model to discriminate between RSOs with a single temperature (e.g. natural rocks) versus human-made satellites with a chassis and deployed solar panels where significant component temperature differences exist under typical orbital configurations.

It is designed for polarization observations of transient sources in the soft X-ray energy range with a wide field of view (FOV). To validate the key technologies required for wide-FOV X-ray polarization measurements, the Cosmic X-ray Polarization Detector (CXPD) CubeSat was developed as a prototype for the LPD. The CXPD is equipped with two Gas Microchannel Plate Pixel Detectors (GMPDs) that measure X-ray polarization via the photoelectric effect, where ejected photoelectrons produce ionization tracks in the gas which are imaged to reconstruct their emission directions. Laboratory calibrations of the modulation factor and energy spectra were successfully performed using linear polarized X-ray sources at 2.98 keV, 4.51 keV, 6.40 keV, and 8.05 keV. Since its launch in June 2023, the CXPD has successfully completed critical in-orbit technology verification. It has also performed polarization observations of two bright X-ray sources Sco X-1 and the transient Swift J1727.8-1613 yielding constraints on their polarization degrees and angles. Notably, this was the first time that an anti-coincidence detector had been implemented in an X-ray polarimeter, enabling in-orbit verification of the charged-particle background rejection algorithm. These results demonstrate the feasibility of wide-field soft X-ray polarization measurements and provide essential guidance for the development of the LPD for the POLAR-2 mission, thereby advancing the frontier of X-ray polarization astronomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "LPD\u662fPOLAR-2\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u66b4\u504f\u632f\u4eea\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0cCXPD\u7acb\u65b9\u661f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u539f\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5bbd\u89c6\u573aX\u5c04\u7ebf\u504f\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5728\u8f68\u6280\u672f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5bf9\u4e24\u4e2a\u660e\u4eaeX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6e90\u7684\u504f\u632f\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bbd\u89c6\u573aX\u5c04\u7ebf\u504f\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3aPOLAR-2\u4efb\u52a1\u7684LPD\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdbX\u5c04\u7ebf\u504f\u632f\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u914d\u5907\u4e24\u4e2a\u6c14\u4f53\u5fae\u901a\u9053\u677f\u50cf\u7d20\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684CXPD\u7acb\u65b9\u661f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u7535\u6548\u5e94\u6d4b\u91cfX\u5c04\u7ebf\u504f\u632f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53cd\u7b26\u5408\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e26\u7535\u7c92\u5b50\u80cc\u666f\u6291\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u5728\u8f68\u6280\u672f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bf9Sco X-1\u548cSwift J1727.8-1613\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u504f\u632f\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u504f\u632f\u5ea6\u548c\u504f\u632f\u89d2\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u80cc\u666f\u6291\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bbd\u89c6\u573a\u8f6fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u504f\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aPOLAR-2\u4efb\u52a1\u7684LPD\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86X\u5c04\u7ebf\u504f\u632f\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Moreover, it is bright with little spectral turnover, and its profile perhaps uniquely remains undistorted by scattering far into the decametric band. Here we assemble more than a dozen of the highest quality profiles (30 MHz to 5 GHz) from half a dozen observatories, where possible polarimetric. The pulsar's 2.6$^{\\circ}$ core component marks the magnetic axis longitude, and we confirm that this point coincides both with the linear polarization angle inflection point and the zero-crossing of its antisymmetric circular signature -- thus providing the possibility to estimate emission heights over a very broad band using aberration/retardation (A/R). We then carefully fit the profile components with Gaussians to identify and study the subtle asymmetries produced by A/R. We find a consistent A/R in the pulsar's profiles of some 0.5$^{\\circ}$ longitude or 2 ms -- corresponding to a putative conal emission height of 200-400 km -- with a formal error of about 100 km. Our analysis finds no evidence whatsoever for an emission height increase with wavelength, the so-called ``radius-to-frequency mapping''.

However, when optimising for parameters of probabilistic models, incorporating second order information during optimisation can lead to a more direct path in the distribution space and faster convergence. In this work we examine whether using natural gradient descent can improve the performance of variational inference based classification of radio galaxies. We use the Improved Variational Online Newton (iVON) algorithm and compare its performance against a recent benchmark for BNNs for radio galaxy classification. We find that iVON results in better uncertainty calibration out of all the methods previously considered while providing similar predictive performance to the best performing inference methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Bayes by Backprop based variational inference. Models trained with iVON can distinguish far out-of-distribution optical galaxy data, but they cannot reliably detect radio galaxy images from a telescope with different resolution and sensitivity. We find that the cold posterior effect persists in the models trained with iVON. Our results suggest that the choice of the optimiser can lead to qualitatively different solutions and future work using probabilistic neural network models should carefully consider the inductive biases being encoded through the optimisation process, in addition to the data, architecture and inference method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5c04\u7535\u661f\u7cfb\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0iVON\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u5c04\u7535\u661f\u7cfb\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e8c\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u5728\u7ebf\u725b\u987f(iVON)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5c04\u7535\u661f\u7cfb\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "iVON\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5148\u524d\u8003\u8651\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0e\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\u7b49\u6700\u4f73\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u8d28\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u7387\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u4ed4\u7ec6\u8003\u8651\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

A key prediction of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models is a transition from poloidally dominated fields near the engine to toroidally dominated fields downstream, yet direct tests within the ACZ are hampered by weak polarization and strong Faraday rotation. We report quasi-simultaneous, high-sensitivity, multifrequency very long baseline interferometric polarimetry of M87 spanning 1.4-24.4GHz. We present high-fidelity, Faraday rotation-corrected maps of intrinsic linear polarization that continuously resolve the ACZ in the de-projected distance range of ~9e3 to ~3.6e5 gravitational radii from the black hole. The maps reveal pronounced north-south asymmetries in fractional linear polarization and electric vector position angle (EVPA), peaking in the inner ACZ at a projected distance of ~20mas along the jet and remaining prominent out to ~100mas. These signatures are best reproduced by models with a large-scale, ordered helical field that retains a substantial poloidal component-contrary to the rapid toroidal dominance expected under steady, ideal MHD. This tension implies ongoing magnetic dissipation that limits toroidal buildup over the ACZ. The handedness of the helix provides an independent constraint on the black hole's spin direction, supporting a spin vector oriented away from the observer, consistent with the orientation inferred from horizon-scale imaging. Farther downstream, the asymmetries diminish, and the EVPA and fractional polarization distributions become more symmetric; we tentatively interpret this as evolution toward a more poloidally dominated configuration, while noting current sensitivity and dynamic-range limits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7M87\u5c04\u7535\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u504f\u632f\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u52a0\u901f-\u51c6\u76f4\u533a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5357\u5317\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u5e8f\u87ba\u65cb\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u7406\u60f3MHD\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u73af\u5411\u573a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u78c1\u8017\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u78c1\u573a\u4ece\u6781\u5411\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5230\u73af\u5411\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u52a0\u901f-\u51c6\u76f4\u533a\u5185\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u76f4\u53d7\u5230\u5f31\u504f\u632f\u548c\u5f3a\u6cd5\u62c9\u7b2c\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75281.4-24.4GHz\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u51c6\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u9891\u7387\u751a\u957f\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e72\u6d89\u504f\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6cd5\u62c9\u7b2c\u65cb\u8f6c\u6821\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u5185\u7980\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u632f\u56fe\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u89e3\u6790\u4e86\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f15\u529b\u534a\u5f84\u7ea69e3\u52303.6e5\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u52a0\u901f-\u51c6\u76f4\u533a\u3002", "result": "\u504f\u632f\u56fe\u663e\u793a\u5728\u52a0\u901f-\u51c6\u76f4\u533a\u5185\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5357\u5317\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u632f\u5206\u6570\u548c\u7535\u573a\u77e2\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u89d2\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u6700\u597d\u7531\u4fdd\u7559\u663e\u8457\u6781\u5411\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u5e8f\u87ba\u65cb\u78c1\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0e\u7406\u60f3MHD\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u73af\u5411\u4e3b\u5bfc\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u78c1\u8017\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9650\u5236\u73af\u5411\u573a\u7684\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u87ba\u65cb\u573a\u7684\u624b\u6027\u4e3a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u81ea\u65cb\u65b9\u5411\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u72ec\u7acb\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u65cb\u77e2\u91cf\u8fdc\u79bb\u89c2\u6d4b\u8005\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e0e\u89c6\u754c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6210\u50cf\u63a8\u65ad\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

The Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) consists of four integral field units (IFU), each of which has three sub-channels. The twelve resulting spectral data cubes have different fields of view, spatial, and spectral resolutions. The wavelength range of each cube partially overlaps with the neighboring bands, and the overlap regions typically show flux mismatches which have to be corrected by spectral stitching methods. Stitching methods aim to produce a single data cube incorporating the data of the individual sub-channels, which requires matching the spatial resolution and the flux discrepancies. We present Haute Couture, a novel stitching algorithm which uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to perform a matrix completion, where the available MRS data cubes are treated as twelve sub-matrices of a larger incomplete matrix. Prior to matrix completion, we also introduce a novel pre-processing to homogenize the global intensities of the twelve cubes. Our pre-processing consists in jointly optimizing a set of global scale parameters that maximize the fit between the cubes where spectral overlap occurs. We apply our novel stitching method to JWST data obtained as part of the PDRs4All observing program of the Orion Bar, and produce a uniform cube reconstructed with the best spatial resolution over the full range of wavelengths.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHaute Couture\u7684\u65b0\u62fc\u63a5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3(NMF)\u8fdb\u884c\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u5c06MRS\u768412\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u89c6\u4e3a\u66f4\u5927\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u5747\u5300\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "JWST\u7684MIRI\u4e2d\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u4eea(MRS)\u768412\u4e2a\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u573a\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u53e0\u533a\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u901a\u91cf\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u62fc\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u6b63\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3(NMF)\u8fdb\u884c\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u5c0612\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u91cd\u53e0\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u62df\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8ePDRs4All\u89c2\u6d4b\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u730e\u6237\u5ea7\u68d2JWST\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u6ce2\u957f\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5747\u5300\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "Haute Couture\u7b97\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MRS\u6570\u636e\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u7684\u62fc\u63a5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5747\u5300\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u3002"}}

Fast-time features of the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum encode information about phenomena such as turbulence, convection, shock revival and potential quark-hadron phase transitions. In this study, we explore the detection capabilities of large-volume neutrino telescopes with a focus on IceCube and the planned extension IceCube-Gen2. Furthermore, we consider the effect on the detection sensitivity from wavelength shifters through enhanced light collection.\n  A variety of models predict periodic fast-time features in supernova light curves; to quantify their detectability without relying on specific models, we investigate the detector response to a generic parameterisation of such features. We find that independent of feature frequency, IceCube-Gen2 instrumented with wavelength shifters has sensitivity to weaker modulations ($>25\\%$ amplitude) as compared to only the strongest modulations ($>50\\%$ amplitude) with IceCube. In addition, we examine the sensitivity of the neutrino lightcurve to sharp features from a quark-hadron phase transition. Phase transitions leading to a quark star remnant are detectable with IceCube at $5\u03c3$ up to the edge of the Galaxy, and throughout the Small Magellanic Cloud with IceCube-Gen2 equipped with wavelength-shifters. In contrast, models collapsing into a black hole are observable only within the Galaxy, covering $41\\%$ of the CCSNe population for IceCube and nearly all ($91\\%$) for IceCube-Gen2 complemented by wavelength shifters.

We examine the influence of the density \u03c1_{s} and radius r_{s} of the DM halo on key disk properties, including the energy flux, temperature distribution, and emission spectrum. Our results show that all three of these quantities decrease with increasing \u03c1_{s} or r_{s}. Furthermore, by generating and analyzing both direct and secondary images of the accretion disk, we explore how the observational inclination angle and the DM halo parameters \u03c1_{s} and rs affect image profiles. Finally, the observed flux distributions are presented for different inclination angles.

Among candidate mechanisms, vortex creep heating (VCH) provides a robust link between spin-down and frictional dissipation in the pinned inner-crust superfluid, yet its interplay with fast DUrca cooling in massive stars remains insufficiently explored.\n  We (i) implement VCH in our cooling code and validate it; (ii) identify the physically consistent domain where the steady-state form $L_{\\text{h}}=J|\\dot\u03a9_\\infty|$ applies; (iii) quantify how $(B,P_0)$ regulate observable VCH signatures under DUrca cooling; and (iv) introduce a 3D representation that resolves degeneracies hidden in standard 2D projections.\n  Cooling is computed with BSk24 and APR EoS, standard pairing gaps, and iron/carbon envelopes. VCH is modeled with $J\\simeq10^{42.9\\text{--}43.8}$ erg s, and a quantum-creep coverage fraction $f_{\\text{Q}}(t)$ diagnoses when steady-state heating is valid. We survey $B=10^{10\\text{--}13}$ G and $P_0=10$--$570$ ms for $1.4$ and $2.0\\,M_\\odot$, and compare with a curated set of ordinary pulsars with measured $(P,\\dot P)$.\n  Results: (1) Our implementation reproduces published VCH bands. (2) The $(B,P_0)$ validity boundary follows magnetic-dipole spin-down, confirming consistency with $|\\dot\u03a9|$. (3) DUrca+VCH maintains $T_{\\text{s}}^\\infty\\gtrsim10^5$ K for $B\\gtrsim10^{11-12}$ G up to $P_0\\sim10^2$ ms. (4) The 3D representation shows that sources appearing coincident in $(t,T_{\\text{s}}^\\infty)$ occupy distinct $B$-layers, removing degeneracies.\n  VCH can substantially reshape late-time thermal states when spin-down power remains high; its observability depends chiefly on $(B,P_0)$ rather than on mass alone. We provide a practical $(B,P_0)$ validity map for $L_{\\text{h}}=J|\\dot\u03a9_\\infty|$ and advocate treating $B$ as a co-equal axis in cooling analyses.

The method self-consistently couples the ejecta circumstellar medium (CSM) shock dynamics to radiative diffusion from a moving heating boundary tied to the shocks, so that both the photon escape path and the effective diffusion time evolve with radius and time. We solve the mass and momentum equations for the forward and reverse shocks together with the diffusion equation in the unshocked CSM. TransFit-CSM reproduces the canonical sequence of an early dark phase, a diffusion-mediated rise and peak, and a post-interaction cooling tail, and it clarifies why Arnett-like peak scalings break down in optically thick CSM. The framework is well suited for Bayesian inference and constrains physical parameters of the ejecta and CSM from bolometric or joint multi-band light curves. Applications to SN 2006gy and SN 2010jl yield accurate fits and physically interpretable posteriors, highlighting the dominant role of pre-supernova mass loss in shaping the observables.

The event was not detected in gamma-rays. Follow-up observations from $\\sim$1.5 to 100 days post-trigger were obtained across X-ray, UV, optical, near-infrared, and radio bands with ground- and space-based facilities. The redshift is constrained to $z = 0.7485$ from prominent optical spectral features. The optical light curve shows complex evolution: an initial $\\sim t^{-0.7}$ decay, followed by a rapid re-brightening peaking at day 7.7 with $\\sim t^{-1.7}$ decay, and a third phase peaking near day 19 with $\\sim t^{-1.3}$ decay. The spectral energy distribution (SED) and its temporal evolution are consistent with a mix of non-thermal and thermal components. Early optical-to-X-ray spectral indices agree with optically thin synchrotron emission, while steepening of the optical SED after $\\sim$20 days indicates either a shift in emission mechanism or the emergence of an additional component. Although broad-lined absorption features are absent, comparisons with type Ic-BL supernovae suggest a SN contribution at late times, suggesting a collapsar origin for EP 241021a. The likely SN in EP 241021a appears to require an additional energy source beyond $^{56}$Ni decay.

In this study, we conducted 12-night multicolor optical monitoring using an 85 cm telescope from 2020 September to 2024 June and collected long-term broad-band archived data from radio to $\u03b3$-rays. Intraday variabilities were detected on four nights, and most of them exhibited a bluer-when-brighter behavior. Both clockwise and counterclockwise spectral hysteresis loops were found within a single night. However, no reliable intraband time lag was detected for the intranight variabilities. On long timescales, the cross-correlation analysis shows that the variations of the optical, X-ray, and $\u03b3$-ray bands do not reveal an obvious time delay, while the variations in the radio bands lagged them by about 370 days. The measured time lags suggest two distinct emission regions respectively responsible for the optical to $\u03b3$-ray radiation and for the radio radiation, with a spatial separation of approximately $4.50\\times10^{19}\\ \\rm cm$. We modeled the broad-band spectral energy distributions during four flaring epochs and one quiescent epoch, and found evidence for the possible persistent existence of a very high energy emission region.

Multi-TeV photons motivate synchrotron self-Compton and possibly hadronic contributions, while the non-detection of coincident neutrinos by IceCube/KM3NeT/GRAND200k constrains the microphysical parameters, jet kinetic energy and ambient medium density. We model the VHE afterglow of GRB 221009A with an external forward shock from a Gaussian structured jet in a uniform density medium. This angular structure reproduces the extreme TeV output at an off-axis angle but without demanding large energies as in a top-hat jet. We also compute the corresponding $p\u03b3$ neutrino flux in the PeV-EeV energies and derive a time-integrated upper limit based on the effective areas of IceCube Gen2 and GRAND200k, providing the contributions of individual GRBs to the neutrino events. The predicted neutrino flux for GRB 221009A with model parameters inferred from multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution lies below the sensitivities of these detectors. Even under highly optimistic microphysical conditions, our correlation analysis infers that the events from this GRB are of order $\\sim 0.1$ for upcoming GRAND200k. We also compare neutrino fluxes for on-axis and off-axis viewing geometries and find that jet orientation alone can introduce nearly an order of magnitude variation in the signal. Thus, our studies imply that a GRB both brighter and closer than GRB 221009A would be crucial for any neutrino detections by upcoming neutrino telescopes. Future GRB detections by the CTA will provide important constraints on their geometry, radiation mechanisms, and any potential associated neutrino signals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86GRB 221009A\u7684\u751a\u9ad8\u80fd\u4f59\u8f89\u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u7ed3\u6784\u55b7\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u6781\u7aefTeV\u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u901a\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u8be5GRB\u7684\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u8fd1LHAASO\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684GRB 221009A\u7684\u6781\u7aefTeV\u8f90\u5c04\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u7535\u5b50\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u81ea\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u548c\u5f3a\u5b50\u8d21\u732e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u975e\u63a2\u6d4b\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u5fae\u89c2\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u7ed3\u6784\u55b7\u6d41\u5728\u5747\u5300\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u524d\u5411\u6fc0\u6ce2\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6a21\u62dfGRB 221009A\u7684\u751a\u9ad8\u80fd\u4f59\u8f89\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u5e94\u7684p\u03b3\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u901a\u91cf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eIceCube Gen2\u548cGRAND200k\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9762\u79ef\u63a8\u5bfc\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "result": "GRB 221009A\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u901a\u91cf\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6700\u4e50\u89c2\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u7269\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cGRAND200k\u4e5f\u53ea\u80fd\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u7ea60.1\u4e2a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\u55b7\u6d41\u53d6\u5411\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fd1\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u6bd4GRB 221009A\u66f4\u4eae\u66f4\u8fd1\u7684GRB\u624d\u80fd\u88ab\u672a\u6765\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\uff0cCTA\u7684\u672a\u6765GRB\u63a2\u6d4b\u5c06\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8f90\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

The source exhibits a stable flux across the entire exposure with no detectable pulsations by any instrument on their X-ray light curves, placing pulsed-fraction upper limits of 10% and 32% for XMM$-$Newton and NuSTAR, respectively. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by two thermal components consistent with the emission from an accretion disk, and shows a weak high-energy tail above 10 keV, with no statistical requirement for an additional nonthermal component. The unabsorbed $0.3-20$ keV luminosity is ${\\sim}2\\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, evidencing the ULX nature of the source. The parameters obtained from spectral modeling are consistent with the hard ultraluminous state. Despite the fact that a neutron-star accretor cannot be ruled out by the available data, under the assumption that the compact object in NGC 5055 ULX X-1 is a black hole accreting through a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure-supported disk that drives an optically thick wind, we constrained its putative mass to $11-26$ M$_{\\odot}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9NGC 5055 ULX X-1\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u5bbd\u5e26X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6e90\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u901a\u91cf\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u70ed\u6210\u5206\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u80fd\u8c31\uff0c\u672a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u8109\u52a8\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5019\u9009\u8005\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u4eaeX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6e90NGC 5055 ULX X-1\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u81f4\u5bc6\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u6216\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff09\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408XMM-Newton\u548cNuSTAR\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u57280.3-20 keV\u80fd\u91cf\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u5bbd\u5e26X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u603b\u66dd\u5149\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6100 ks\u3002", "result": "\u6e90\u901a\u91cf\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u672a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u8109\u52a8\uff0c\u80fd\u8c31\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u70ed\u6210\u5206\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f31\u7684\u9ad8\u80fd\u5c3e\u90e8\uff0c\u672a\u5438\u6536\u76840.3-20 keV\u5149\u5ea6\u7ea6\u4e3a2\u00d710^40 erg/s\u3002\u5728\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e3a11-26\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "NGC 5055 ULX X-1\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u786c\u8d85\u4eae\u72b6\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5438\u79ef\u4f53\u4e0d\u80fd\u6392\u9664\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}
