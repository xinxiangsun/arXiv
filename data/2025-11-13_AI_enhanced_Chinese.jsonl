This paper details the core modules of CPISM that simulate the CPI-C instrument, focusing on the simulation of the high-contrast imaging optical system and the visible-band science camera. We modeled key optical components, such as the transmission apodizing filter, the wavefront corrector, and the focal plane mask using the HCIPy package. A $10^{-8}$ contrast dark hole region, consistent with design specifications, was simulated using the Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) optimization method, and broadband observation effects were considered. For the science camera, which is an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD), we established a detailed model encompassing photon collection, charge transfer, electron multiplication (EM), and readout processes, based on test data. This model simulates complex instrumental features including dark current, charge transfer efficiency, clock-induced charge, multiplication noise factor, and various readout effects like striping and drift. We also proposed and validated an improved statistical model for the EM process to enhance simulation efficiency. CPISM can generate simulated images containing rich instrumental details, closely similar to the expected real observational data, thus laying the foundation for the development and verification of CPI-C data processing algorithms and preparations for future scientific research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CPISM\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4eea\u5668\u6a21\u62df\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u56fd\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ad9\u671b\u8fdc\u955cCPI-C\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u6210\u50cf\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u79d1\u5b66\u76f8\u673a\u3002", "motivation": "\u652f\u6301CPI-C\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u505a\u51c6\u5907\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528HCIPy\u5305\u5efa\u6a21\u5173\u952e\u5149\u5b66\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528EFC\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u6697\u5b54\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u7acbEMCCD\u79d1\u5b66\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u7b26\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u683c\u768410^-8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u6697\u5b54\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u4eea\u5668\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e0e\u9884\u671f\u771f\u5b9e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "CPISM\u4e3aCPI-C\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u505a\u597d\u4e86\u51c6\u5907\u3002"}}

We show that, under dark conditions, these devices are generation recombination (GR) noise dominated down to 0.1 Hz and, under optical load, they are likely dominated by GR and photon noise down to tenths of a Hz and possibly lower, both in spite of the use of a-Si:H PPCs. Our measurements set limits on the low-frequency two-level-system (TLS) noise of the a-Si:H material that are consistent with higher frequency measurements in the 0.1-10 kHz regime.

To achieve these goals, three groups of superconducting lumped-element on-chip low-pass/band-pass filter-banks were designed to hierarchically sum the superconducting, broadband, non-resonant, slot-dipole antenna arrays and band-pass filter the trans-mm light before outputting it on microstripline to detectors (KIDs in the case of NEW-MUSIC).", "AI": {"tldr": "NEW-MUSIC\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u516d\u6ce2\u6bb5\u8de8\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u504f\u632f\u8ba1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5bbd\u5e26\u5206\u5c42\u76f8\u63a7\u9635\u5929\u7ebf\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u5e26\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u8986\u76d680-420 GHz\u9891\u6bb5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u8de8\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u53d1\u5c04\u3001SZ\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u5c18\u57c3\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u9996\u4e2a\u516d\u6ce2\u6bb5\u8de8\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u504f\u632f\u8ba1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u8de8\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u53d1\u5c04\u3001\u5229\u7528SZ\u6548\u5e94\u7814\u7a76\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u548c\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u70ed\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u4ece\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u533a\u5230\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u5c18\u57c3\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u5c18\u57c3\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u7ec4\u8d85\u5bfc\u96c6\u603b\u5143\u4ef6\u7247\u4e0a\u4f4e\u901a/\u5e26\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7ec4\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u6c42\u548c\u8d85\u5bfc\u5bbd\u5e26\u975e\u8c10\u632f\u7f1d\u9699\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u5230\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u524d\u5bf9\u8de8\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u5149\u8fdb\u884c\u5e26\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8986\u76d62.4\u500d\u9891\u7a0b\uff0880-420 GHz\uff09\u7684\u5bbd\u5e26\u5206\u5c42\u76f8\u63a7\u9635\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u5e26\u5b9a\u4e49\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u4e3aNEW-MUSIC\u4eea\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bbd\u5e26\u5206\u5c42\u76f8\u63a7\u9635\u5929\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6210\u529f\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86NEW-MUSIC\u4eea\u5668\u5bf9\u8de8\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u504f\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u5929\u6587\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we study the time-resolved signal expected from such early shocks. An internal collision is modeled using a 1D special relativistic hydrodynamical simulation and the photon distributions in the resulting forward and reverse shocks, as well as in the common downstream region, are followed to well above the photosphere using a designated RMS simulation code. The light curve and time resolved spectrum of the resulting single pulse is computed taking into account the emission at different optical depths and angles to the line-of-sight. For the specific case considered, we find a light curve consisting of a short pulse lasting $\\sim 0.1$ s for an assumed redshift of $z = 1$. The efficiency is large, with $\\approx 23$% of the total burst energy being radiated. The spectrum has a complex shape at very early times, after which it settles into a more generic shape with a smooth curvature below the peak energy, $E_p$, and a clear high-energy power law that cuts off at $\\sim 5$ MeV in the observer frame. The spectrum becomes narrower and softer at late times with $E_p$ steadily decreasing during the pulse decay from $E_p \\approx 250~$keV to $E_p \\approx 100$ keV. The low-energy index, $\u03b1$, decreases during the bright part of the pulse from $\u03b1\\approx -0.5$ to $\u03b1\\approx -1$, although the low-energy part is better fit with a broken power law when the signal-to-noise ratio is high. The high-energy power law is generated by the reverse shock at low optical depths ($\u03c4< 30$) and has an index that decreases from $\u03b2\\approx -2$ to $\u03b2\\approx -2.4$.

In this work, we explore AI-driven symbolic regression (SR) frameworks to derive updated analytical relations for disk ejecta mass in binary neutron star mergers, trained on state-of-the-art numerical relativity simulations. Our method reveals a set of compact equations that outperform existing fitting formulae across multiple statistical metrics while remaining physically interpretable. Notably, SR also enables alternative predictor sets (e.g., $\\{M_1,M_2,\\tilde\u039b\\}$) that match or exceed the accuracy of models relying solely on compactness of the lightest neutron star ($C_1$), enabling new parameter constraints from electromagnetic observations. Unlike traditional black-box machine learning models, these closed-form expressions generalize robustly to regions of the parameter space not represented in the training data, offering a physics-informed tool for multimessenger observations and constraints on the neutron star equation of state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u5bfc\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5408\u5e76\u540e\u76d8\u629b\u5c04\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u5173\u7cfb\u5f0f\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u62df\u5408\u516c\u5f0f\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6e90\u4e0e\u7535\u78c1\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f53\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8fde\u63a5\u81f4\u5bc6\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u5408\u5e76\u540e\u6b8b\u9ab8\u53ca\u8d28\u91cf\u5916\u6d41\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6570\u503c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u91c7\u7528AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63a8\u5bfc\u76d8\u629b\u5c04\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u89e3\u6790\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u7ec4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u62df\u5408\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u66ff\u4ee3\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\u96c6\uff0c\u5176\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u8f7b\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u81f4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u9ed1\u76d2\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we develop a deep learning framework based on a residual one-dimensional convolutional neural network for lensed GW identification under multiband observations. The model directly processes multiband waveforms from binary neutron star systems, covering the early inspiral observed by the DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and the late inspiral observed by the Einstein Telescope (ET), corresponding approximately to the wave-optics and geometrical-optics regimes, respectively. It enables end-to-end classification of five classes: pure noise, unlensed GWs, and three representative lensed GWs corresponding to singular isothermal sphere (SIS), cored isothermal sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles. A dataset of 10^6 simulated samples was constructed with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 5 to 100. The deep learning model with multiband observations achieves an accuracy of 97.0% and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.97, significantly exceeding the single-detector performance, where DECIGO and ET reach 72.8% and 62.3%, respectively. Even in the low-SNR regime (SNR < 20), the model maintains an accuracy above 63%, while in the high-SNR regime (SNR > 80), its accuracy approaches 99.8%.

We update the code by implementing pulsar spin-down due to magnetic braking and spin-up through accretion, and use this framework to model the pulsar population in the globular cluster M71 to investigate the pulsar population within and the associated gravitational wave transients.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u65b0N\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u6beb\u79d2\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u79cd\u7fa4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8M71\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u77ac\u53d8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u5df2\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc7300\u4e2a\u6beb\u79d2\u8109\u51b2\u661f\uff0c\u5360\u5df2\u77e5\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u6beb\u79d2\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u603b\u6570\u7684\u4e00\u534a\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u79cd\u7fa4\u7279\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u76f4\u63a5N\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u4ee3\u7801NBODY6++GPU\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u81ea\u8f6c\u51cf\u6162\uff08\u78c1\u5236\u52a8\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u8f6c\u52a0\u901f\uff08\u5438\u79ef\uff09\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u79cd\u7fa4\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u62df\u4e86M71\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u79cd\u7fa4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u77ac\u53d8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684N\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u6beb\u79d2\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u548c\u79cd\u7fa4\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

The method favors the widely used on-the-fly emission--absorption approximation, which is state of the art in many production hydro codes when scattering is isotropic. Ray-trax vectorizes across rays and sources, supports arbitrarily many frequency bins without architectural changes, and exposes end-to-end gradients, making it straightforward to couple with differentiable hydro solvers while preserving differentiability.

This resonance locks the binary into a unique state where the neutron star spin evolves alongside the orbit. The resonance requires a finite neutron star ellipticity $\u03b5$ possibly sourced by strong internal magnetic fields in magnetars, which are motivated by population study of eccentric neutron star-black hole binary GW200105. We find that the locking probability is proportional to $\\sqrt\u03b5$. We derive the phase correction in the gravitational waveform due to this resonance locking effect, and have conducted a search in all neutron star binaries up to the O4a gravitational-wave catalog, with no positive event found so far. Observations by next-generation detectors such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, or even the upcoming upgrade of Advanced LIGO, have the potential to detect such locking signals, enabling precise measurements of both neutron star's ellipticity and moment of inertia.

Despite over 50 years of research and measurements their prompt emission remains poorly understood, with key questions surrounding the structure of relativistic jets, magnetic field configurations, and dominant radiation mechanisms. Polarization measurements are critical in resolving these uncertainties. The POLAR mission, operational in 2016-2017 on Tiangong-2, provided the most statistically significant GRB polarization data. Its results indicated low time-averaged polarization with hints of temporal evolution. However, POLAR's limited sensitivity, small effective area, and restricted energy range prevented more detailed time- and energy-resolved analyses in addition to a larger sample of GRB polarization measurements. POLAR-2 is designed to address these limitations by offering a fourfold increase in effective area (at least) and an extended energy range of 30-800 keV by utilizing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and an updated module design, enabling the differentiation of competing GRB emission models. The instrument comprises of 100 polarimeter modules (each with 64 plastic scintillator bars), wherein the polarization angle is extracted through Compton Scattering of the gammas. The polarimeter module design was validated during an ESRF beam test campaign in 2023. The instrument was developed by a joint effort of Switzerland, China, Poland and Germany and is planned for launch in 2027.

Matches version for publication", "summary": "Arrays of precisely-timed millisecond pulsars are used to search for gravitational waves with periods of months to decades. Gravitational waves affect the path of radio pulses propagating from a pulsar to Earth, causing the arrival times of those pulses to deviate from expectations based on the physical characteristics of the pulsar system. By correlating these timing residuals in a pulsar timing array (PTA), one can search for a statistically isotropic background of gravitational waves by revealing evidence for a distinctive pattern predicted by General Relativity, known as the Hellings \\& Downs curve. On June 29 2023, five regional PTA collaborations announced the first evidence for GWs at light-year wavelengths, predicated on support for this correlation pattern with statistical significances ranging from $\\sim\\!2-4\u03c3$. The amplitude and shape of the recovered GW spectrum has also allowed many investigations of the expected source characteristics, ranging from a cosmic population of supermassive binary black holes to numerous processes in the early Universe. In the future, we expect to resolve signals from individual binary systems of supermassive black holes, and probe fundamental assumptions about the background, including its polarization, anisotropy, Gaussianity, and stationarity, all of which will aid efforts to discriminate its origin. In tandem with new facilities like DSA-2000 and the SKA, fueling further observations by regional PTAs and the International Pulsar Timing Array, PTAs have extraordinary potential to be engines of nanohertz GW discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u6beb\u79d2\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u9635\u5217\u63a2\u6d4b\u7eb3\u8d6b\u5179\u9891\u6bb5\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u5173\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u5b87\u5b99\u8d77\u6e90\u673a\u5236", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8ba1\u65f6\u9635\u5217\u63a2\u6d4b\u6ce2\u957f\u5728\u5149\u5e74\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7684Hellings & Downs\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u5f0f", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8ba1\u65f6\u9635\u5217\u5206\u6790\u8109\u51b2\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u4f59\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5bfb\u627e\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81", "result": "2023\u5e746\u670829\u65e5\u9996\u6b21\u53d1\u73b0\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u8fbe\u52302-4\u03c3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86GW\u9891\u8c31\u7684\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u7279\u5f81", "conclusion": "\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8ba1\u65f6\u9635\u5217\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u80fd\u89e3\u6790\u5355\u4e2a\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u6d4b\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u6781\u5316\u3001\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7b49\u57fa\u672c\u7279\u6027"}}

To investigate the underlying emission mechanisms, we performed a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis using multiwavelength data from \\textit{Swift}-XRT/UVOT and \\textit{Fermi}-LAT, covering the optical/UV to GeV $\u03b3$-ray bands. The source shows strong energy-dependent variability, with the largest fractional variability in $\u03b3$-rays, followed by X-rays and UV/optical, consistent with leptonic emission scenarios. Based on the variability patterns, we identified distinct flux states (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, VHE-FX1, and VHE-FX2). The X-ray spectra exhibit a clear ``harder-when-brighter'' trend across these states. We modeled the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using a one-zone model incorporating synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission, implemented in \\textsc{xspec} using $\u03c7^{2}$ minimization. During the VHE detection, the corresponding X-ray/optical emission likely resembled the F2 state. Modeling the VHE SED using F1-state data led to an SSC overprediction of the VHE flux, whereas all other states were well described within the one-zone framework. Systematic trends in physical parameters are observed across flux states, including spectral hardening, increasing break energy, rising bulk Lorentz factor, and decreasing magnetic field with increasing flux. These results suggest that enhanced particle acceleration efficiency and stronger Doppler boosting drive the observed flaring activity, while the decrease in magnetic field indicates conversion of magnetic energy into particle kinetic energy, consistent with shock-driven scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u9ad8\u540c\u6b65\u5cf0BL Lac\u5929\u4f531ES 1959+650\u5728MJD 60310-60603\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u533a\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u81ea\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u5bbd\u5e26\u80fd\u8c31\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a761ES 1959+650\u5728LHAASO\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u751a\u9ad8\u80fd\u8f90\u5c04\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8000\u53d1\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Swift-XRT/UVOT\u548cFermi-LAT\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u533a\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u81ea\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5bbd\u5e26\u80fd\u8c31\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u53d8\u5316\u6700\u5927\uff1bX\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u8c31\u5448\u73b0\"\u8d8a\u4eae\u8d8a\u786c\"\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1bVHE\u63a2\u6d4b\u671f\u95f4\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf/\u5149\u5b66\u53d1\u5c04\u7c7b\u4f3cF2\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u968f\u901a\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\u5448\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u63a8\u52a8\u9a71\u52a8\u4e86\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u8000\u53d1\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u78c1\u573a\u51cf\u5c0f\u8868\u660e\u78c1\u80fd\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7c92\u5b50\u52a8\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0e\u51b2\u51fb\u9a71\u52a8\u60c5\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

Submitted to SPIE Journal of Astronomical Telescopes, Instruments, and Systems", "summary": "The spatial sensitivity pattern of millimeter-wavelength receivers is an important diagnostic of performance and is affected by the alignment of coupling optics. Characterization can be challenging in the field, particularly in the decentered and tightly packed optical configurations that are employed for many astronomical millimeter-wave cameras. In this paper, we present the design and performance of a lightweight and reconfigurable beam mapper, consisting of a bank of thermal sources positioned by a planar cable-driven robot. We describe how the measurement requirements and mechanical constraints of the Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME) optical relay drive the design of the mapper. To quantify the positioning performance, we predict the beam patterns at each surface to derive requirements and use a non-contact computer-vision based method built on OpenCV to track the payload position with an accuracy better than 1.0 mm.

The growing sample of systems with highly unequal masses, such as GW190814 with $m_1=23.2\\,M_{\\odot}$ and $m_2=2.59\\,M_{\\odot}$ -- corresponding to a mass ratio $q=0.112$ -- cannot be readily explained by isolated binary evolution and may originate through dynamical assembly in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We investigate AGN discs capable of producing GW190814-like mergers using \\texttt{pAGN} to model self-consistent AGN torques, coupled with \\texttt{TSUNAMI}, a regularised N-body code including post-Newtonian terms up to 3.5 order. Suites of N-body simulations reveal possible outcomes of binary capture and merger, mean-motion resonance interactions, and other novel dynamical pathways. We develop analytical models linking the branching ratios of captures and mergers to local disc properties, applicable to black hole populations across all mass ratios. Capture probability is primarily governed by $\\mathscr{B}$, the ratio of libration time to resonance-width crossing, and is well-described by a log-Gaussian, $P(\\rm{capture}|\\mathscr{B}) = A \\exp[-(\\ln \\mathscr{B}-\u03bc)^2/2\u03c3^2]$, with $A = 0.41^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, $\u03bc= 1.09^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$, $\u03c3= 1.05^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$. This fit, while an upper limit, is useful for simplified population synthesis. Finally, we explore the mass ratio AGN luminosity parameter space and find that GW190814 may be formed in a low luminosity AGN of $L_{\\rm AGN}\\approx 10^{43.5}\\ \\rm erg\\ s^{-1}$. A more systematic parameter space exploration and future population studies will further test our predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\uff08AGN\uff09\u76d8\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210GW190814\u7c7b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6355\u83b7\u6982\u7387\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0GW190814\u53ef\u80fd\u5f62\u6210\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5149\u5ea6AGN\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91caGW190814\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u6781\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b64\u7acb\u53cc\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8eAGN\u76d8\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ec4\u88c5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528pAGN\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u81ea\u6d3d\u7684AGN\u529b\u77e9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5305\u542b3.5\u9636\u540e\u725b\u987f\u9879\u7684TSUNAMI\u6b63\u5219\u5316N\u4f53\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53cc\u661f\u6355\u83b7\u3001\u5408\u5e76\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u8fd0\u52a8\u5171\u632f\u7b49\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u6355\u83b7\u6982\u7387\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7libration\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u5171\u632f\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7a7f\u8d8a\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u503c\u7684\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u5bf9\u6570\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1bGW190814\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u5149\u5ea6\u7ea610^43.5 erg/s\u7684\u4f4e\u5149\u5ea6AGN\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "AGN\u76d8\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u6781\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Using an observation of Jupiter to calibrate detector gains and pointing offsets, we process the Sgr A observation in a purpose-built pipeline that removes correlated noise through common-mode subtraction with correlation-weighted scaling, and uses map-domain principal component analysis to identify further systematic errors. The resulting frequency-resolved maps recover strong 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) emission, and a continuum component whose spectral index discriminates free-free emission in the circumnuclear disk (CND) versus thermal dust emission in the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds. Broadband continuum flux comparisons with the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) show agreement to within $\\sim$5% in high-SNR molecular clouds in the Sgr A region. From the CO line detections, we estimate a molecular hydrogen mass of between $5.4 \\times 10^5 M_\\odot$ and $5.7 \\times 10^5 M_\\odot$, consistent with prior studies.

The light curve of PKS 1309+1154 exhibits a 17.9 year periodicity. We also reported a hint of a first harmonic with a 9 year periodicity in this object. Further analysis of the PKS J1309+1154 light curve provides compelling evidence that both the fundamental and the harmonic are real, confirming the existence of real periodicities in blazar light curves. This is the first case, to our knowledge, of watertight evidence for a fundamental and a harmonic periodicity in a blazar light curve. It makes PKS J1309+1154 a \\textit{strong\\/} supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) candidate, and thus the third such candidate to be revealed through long-term radio monitoring, the other two being PKS J0805--0111 and PKS 2131--021, both discovered through the OVRO 40 m Telescope monitoring program. It is argued that hundreds of SMBHB candidates will be discovered by the Vera Rubin and Simons Observatories. Coherent searches for gravitational waves from a network of SMBHB candidates, starting immediately, are strongly motivated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728PKS J1309+1154\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8617.9\u5e74\u57fa\u672c\u5468\u671f\u548c9\u5e74\u8c10\u6ce2\u5468\u671f\u7684\u660e\u786e\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e2d\u786e\u8ba4\u5b58\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u5468\u671f\u548c\u8c10\u6ce2\u5468\u671f\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u5f3a\u8d85\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u671f\u5c04\u7535\u76d1\u6d4b\u5bfb\u627e\u8d85\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e2d\u5468\u671f\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u540846\u5e74\u7684\u5bc6\u6b47\u6839\u5927\u5b66\u5c04\u7535\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u548c\u6b27\u6587\u65af\u8c37\u5c04\u7535\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u76d1\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790PKS J1309+1154\u572814.5/15 GHz\u7684\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b017.9\u5e74\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5468\u671f\u548c9\u5e74\u7684\u8c10\u6ce2\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u5468\u671f\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u671f\u5c04\u7535\u76d1\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u8d85\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "PKS J1309+1154\u662f\u5f3a\u8d85\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u6709\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e94\u7acb\u5373\u5f00\u59cb\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u76f8\u5e72\u641c\u7d22\u3002"}}

To model the spectral energy distribution of these new sources, we apply the hybrid shock-turbulence acceleration framework previously developed for extreme high-frequency-peaked BL Lacs. We present three representative realizations that produce synchrotron peaks between $0.2$ and $2$ MeV and evaluate their multiwavelenght signatures. Our results show that UEHBLs would be undetectable with current GeV (Fermi) and future TeV (CTA) facilities due to severe Klein-Nishina suppression of inverse Compton scattering, but are ideal targets for proposed MeV missions such as COSI, AMEGO-X, and e-ASTROGAM. We further identify a sample of hard X-ray sources from the Swift-BAT catalogs that exhibit the expected spectral properties of UEHBLs, potentially representing the first observational hints of this population. If confirmed, UEHBLs would provide unique insight into particle acceleration in relativistic jets, imposing strong constraints on the maximum achievable electron energies. We also discuss the expected polarization and variability signatures, including the possibility of synchrotron-driven thermal instabilities leading to MeV flares. These findings underscore the critical importance of the MeV band for discovering and characterizing the most extreme accelerators among blazars.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u65b0\u7684BL Lac\u5929\u4f53\u2014\u2014\u8d85\u6781\u7aef\u9ad8\u80fd\u5cf0BL Lacs (UEHBLs)\uff0c\u5176\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u5cf0\u503c\u4f4d\u4e8eMeV\u6ce2\u6bb5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6781\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u65b0\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u5cf0\u503c\u5728MeV\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7684\u65b0\u578bBL Lac\u5929\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u55b7\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6fc0\u6ce2-\u6e4d\u6d41\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9UEHBLs\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u5cf0\u503c\u57280.2-2 MeV\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "UEHBLs\u5728\u5f53\u524dGeV\u548c\u672a\u6765TeV\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u9002\u5408MeV\u6ce2\u6bb5\u4efb\u52a1\u63a2\u6d4b\u3002\u4eceSwift-BAT\u76ee\u5f55\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5177\u6709UEHBLs\u9884\u671f\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u786cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6e90\u6837\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "UEHBLs\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u5c06\u4e3a\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u55b7\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u63d0\u4f9b\u72ec\u7279\u89c1\u89e3\uff0cMeV\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u6700\u6781\u7aef\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}
