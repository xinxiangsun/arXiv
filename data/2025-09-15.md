TL;DR: LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA合作组使用红移校正的种群模型，在第四次观测运行中发现了亚阈值引力波信号GW231109_235456，假警报率约为每10年一次，可能是双中子星并合事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高对双中子星引力波信号的探测灵敏度，通过结合射电观测的银河系双中子星系统红移校正种群模型来增强对目标群体的敏感性。

Method: 使用LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA第四次观测运行数据，采用红移校正的种群模型进行亚阈值搜索，分析网络信噪比和假警报率。

Result: 发现显著触发信号GW231109_235456，网络信噪比9.7，假警报率约每50年一次（经多重检验校正后为每10年一次）。推断主星质量1.40-2.24太阳质量，次星质量0.97-1.49太阳质量，总质量2.95太阳质量，定位区域450平方度，光度距离165兆秒差距。

Conclusion: GW231109_235456是一个有前景的亚阈值双中子星并合候选体，如果确认为天体物理起源，将提供重要的双中子星种群信息。

Abstract: We present a sub-threshold search for gravitational-wave inspirals from
binary neutron stars using data from the first part of the fourth observing run
of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. To enhance sensitivity to this targeted
population, we incorporate a redshift-corrected population model based on radio
observations of Galactic double neutron star systems. The search identifies a
significant trigger with a false-alarm rate of about one per 50 years and a
network signal-to-noise ratio of 9.7, which was first reported by the LVK in
low-latency processing as S231109ci and subsequently in the GWTC-4.0 catalog as
GW231109_235456, a sub-threshold candidate. Accounting for a trials factor of
five from the four LVK searches in GWTC-4.0 and this new search, the
false-alarm rate of the reported candidate is approximately one per 10 years.
If this event is of astrophysical origin, the inferred source properties
indicate component masses of 1.40 to 2.24 solar masses for the primary and 0.97
to 1.49 solar masses for the secondary, yielding a total mass of 2.95 (+0.38,
-0.07) solar masses. The event was localized to a region of 450 square degrees
(90 percent probability) at a luminosity distance of 165 (+70, -69)
megaparsecs.

Motivation: 解决宽视场仪器（如Fermi/GBM）探测到的伽马暴初始定位区域大、光学余辉难以识别的问题，利用GOTO望远镜的宽视场和快速响应能力进行光学跟蹤定位。

Method: 使用GOTO望远镜对7个Fermi/GBM和MAXI/GSC触发的长伽马暴进行光学余辉定位和多波段跟蹤观测，利用VLT/X-shooter和GTC/OSIRIS进行光谱观测获得红移，分析Fermi和MAXI的瞬时辐射数据。

Conclusion: 光学发现定位不佳的伽马暴可能存在观测偏差，偏向于高光度、高峰值能量的明亮事件，同时为喷流微观物理和中心引擎多样性提供了新见解。

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), particularly those detected by wide-field
instruments such as the Fermi/GBM, pose a challenge for optical follow-up due
to their large initial localisation regions, leaving many GRBs without
identified afterglows. The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer
(GOTO), with its wide field of view, dual-site coverage, and robotic
rapid-response capability, bridges this gap by rapidly identifying and
localising afterglows from alerts issued by space-based facilities including
Fermi, SVOM, Swift, and the EP, providing early optical positions for
coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up. In this paper, we present optical
afterglow localisation and multi-band follow-up of seven Fermi/GBM and MAXI/GSC
triggered long GRBs (240122A, 240225B, 240619A, 240910A, 240916A, 241002B, and
241228B) discovered by GOTO in 2024. Spectroscopy for six GRBs (no
spectroscopic data for GRB 241002B) with VLT/X-shooter and GTC/OSIRIS yields
precise redshifts spanning $z\approx0.40-$3.16 and absorption-line diagnostics
of host and intervening systems. Radio detections for four events confirm the
presence of long-lived synchrotron emission. Prompt-emission analysis with
Fermi and MAXI data reveals a spectrally hard population, with two bursts lying
$>3\sigma$ above the Amati relation. Although their optical afterglows resemble
those of typical long GRBs, the prompt spectra are consistently harder than the
long-GRB average. Consistent modelling of six GOTO-discovered GRB afterglows
yields jet half-opening angles of a few degrees and beaming-corrected kinetic
energies ($E_{jet}\sim10^{51-52}$) erg, consistent with the canonical long-GRB
population. These findings suggest that optical discovery of poorly localised
GRBs may be subject to observational biases favouring luminous events with high
spectral peak energy, while also providing insight into jet microphysics and
central engine diversity.

### [3] [Propeller effect in action: unveiling quenched accretion in the transient X-ray pulsar 4U 0115+63](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09860)
*Hua Xiao,Sergey S. Tsygankov,Valery F. Suleimanov,Alexander A. Mushtukov,Long Ji,Juri Poutanen*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 对Be/X射线脉冲星4U 0115+63在2023年爆发后进入宁静状态的研究，发现其X射线辐射不是由吸积驱动，而是由propeller效应导致吸积完全停止，可能涉及中子星壳层冷却机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究4U 0115+63在爆发后宁静状态下的X射线辐射特性，探索propeller效应在抑制吸积过程中的作用机制。

Method: 使用XMM-Newton望远镜进行三次观测，分析X射线脉动、功率密度谱和能谱特性，检测脉冲频率和脉冲分数。

Result: 在低光度状态下（LX ∼ 10³³ erg/s）检测到≈0.277 Hz的X射线脉动，脉冲分数超过50%；能谱可用单一黑体成分描述，发射区域小于吸积阶段的极冠尺寸；功率密度谱无显著低频红噪声。

Conclusion: 宁静状态下的辐射不是由吸积驱动，propeller效应导致吸积完全停止，脉动可能由中子星壳层冷却或其他机制产生。

Abstract: The Be/X-ray pulsar 4U 0115+63 underwent a type II outburst in 2023. After
the outburst, similar to the outbursts in 2015 and 2017, the source decayed
into a quiescent state. Two out of three XMM-Newton observations conducted
after the 2023 outburst confirmed the source to be in a low-luminosity state at
a level of $L_{\rm X} \sim 10^{33}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. X-ray pulsations were
detected at $\approx$0.277 Hz in both observations with a pulsed fraction
exceeding 50%. The power density spectra show no significant low-frequency red
noise in both observations, suggesting that the radiation is not driven by
accretion. The energy spectra in this state can be described by a single
blackbody component, with an emitting area smaller than the typical size of the
polar caps during the accretion phase. Based on the timing and spectral
properties, we suggest that the propeller effect is active during the quiescent
state, resulting in a total quenching of accretion. We discuss possible
mechanisms for the generation of pulsations in this regime and consider the
scenario of neutron star crust cooling.

TL;DR: 该研究使用pistroke形式主义分析GWTC-4数据，发现45M⊙质量间隙、χeff分布展宽、χ≈0.2和0.7的自旋幅度特征，但质疑质量比与χeff的反相关性可能是虚假的


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统双黑洞种群模型解释困难的问题，避免建模选择对结果的影响，直接从数据中识别真实特征

Method: 采用pistroke形式主义方法，仅基于LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA第四引力波瞬变目录(GWTC-4)数据进行分析，不依赖特定种群模型

Result: 支持45M⊙质量间隙存在，发现χeff分布在该质量附近展宽，识别出χ≈0.2和0.7的自旋幅度特征，质疑质量比与χeff反相关性的真实性

Conclusion: pistroke方法能有效识别数据中的真实特征，避免模型误设影响，为未来种群模型开发提供指导，并发布了相关数据供进一步研究

Abstract: Current population models of binary black hole distributions are difficult to
interpret because standard population inferences hinge on modeling choices,
which can mask or mimic real structure. The maximum population likelihood
``$\pistroke$ formalism'' provides a means to investigate and interpret
features in the distribution of binary black holes using only data -- without
specifying a population model. It tells us if features inferred from current
population models are truly present in the data or if they arise from model
misspecification. It also provides guidance for developing new models by
highlighting previously unnoticed features. In this study, we utilize the
$\pistroke$ formalism to examine the binary black hole population in the
LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4).
Our analysis supports the existence of a gap around $45\,M_\odot$ in the
secondary black hole mass distribution and identifies a widening in the
distribution of the effective inspiral spin parameter $\chi_\text{eff}$ near
this mass as recently reported by Tong et al. (2025). Similar to earlier
studies, we find support for an anti-correlation between $\chi_\text{eff}$ and
mass ratio. However, we argue that this may be a spurious correlation arising
from misspecification of the joint distribution of black hole masses.
Furthermore, we identify support for dimensionless black hole spin magnitudes
at approximately $\chi \approx 0.2$ and $\chi\approx0.7$. The data support the
existence of a correlation between the spin magnitudes $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$,
though subsequent study is required to determine if this feature is
statistically significant. The accompanying data release includes $\pistroke$
samples, which can be used to compare theoretical predictions to LVK data and
to assess assumptions in parameterised models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大质量星核心/包层中喷流穿透的稳定性问题，分析磁化和旋转效应对喷流不稳定性的影响

Method: 通过拉普拉斯时间变换和傅里叶空间变换求解非相对论磁流体动力学线性方程，在复平面中寻找极点奇点来获取所有不稳定模式，并通过二阶扰动分析确定驱动机制

Result: 在非旋转模型中识别出开尔文-亥姆霍兹不稳定性(KHI)和电流驱动不稳定性(如扭折不稳定性KKI)；在旋转模型中发现磁旋转不稳定性(MRI)；发现模式特征随喷流速度增加会从KKI向KHI转换或从MRI向KHI转换

Conclusion: 磁化和旋转喷流在环境介质中表现出多种不稳定性模式的复杂相互作用，这些模式可以随速度变化而连续转换，对理解天体物理喷流稳定性具有重要意义

Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a linear stability analysis of magnetized and/or
rotating jets propagating in ambient matter that is also magnetized and/or
rotating, having in mind the application to the jet penetrating the
core/envelope of a massive star. We solve the linearized magneto-hydrodynamic
(MHD) equations in the non-relativistic regime by Laplace transform in time and
Fourier transform in space. In this formulation all unstable modes with the
same translational and azimuthal wave numbers can be obtained simultaneously by
searching for pole singularities in the complex plane. In order to determine
unambiguously their driving mechanisms, we evaluate the second-order
perturbation of the MHD Hamiltonian for individual eigenfunctions derived at
these singular points. We identify in our non-rotating models the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) as one of the shear-driven modes and the
current-driven instability such as the kink instability (KKI). In rotational
models we also find the magnetorotational instability (MRI) as another
shear-driven mode. In some cases, we find that a mode changes its character
continuously from KKI to KHI (and vice versa) or from MRI to KHI as the jet
velocity is increased.

TL;DR: 提出了磁星旋转扭曲磁层的近似解析解，发现磁扭曲增加会导致Y点半径减小、极冠增大、粒子流出光度增强等效应，这些结果与磁星射电辐射和快速射电暴的观测特征一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究磁星扭曲磁层的物理特性，解释磁星射电辐射和快速射电暴的观测现象，特别是磁扭曲对磁层结构和辐射特性的影响。

Method: 采用自相似扭曲偶极场近似描述极向磁通，通过最小扭矩模型获得环向磁场，建立旋转扭曲磁层的解析解模型。

Result: 发现磁扭曲增加会导致：Y点半径减小、极冠面积增大、粒子流出光度增强、最大加速电位和脉冲宽度增加；解扭曲过程会逐渐趋近正常脉冲星特性。

Conclusion: 旋转扭曲磁层具有更大的开放场线区域，磁星射电辐射和快速射电暴可能都起源于这些更大且演化的开放场线区域，较大的极冠可能对应磁星爆发时的热点。

Abstract: An approximate analytical solution for the rotating twisted magnetosphere of
magnetars is presented. The poloidal flux is approximated by the self-similar
twisted dipole field. The toroidal field is obtained by the minimum torque
model. Under this approximation, it is found that: (1) The Y-point radius
decreases with the increase of twist of the magnetic field. (2) The polar cap
is larger for larger twist. (3) The particle outflow luminosity is larger for
larger twist. (4) The maximum acceleration potential, pulse width of magnetar
radio emission etc all increase with the twist. (5) For an untwisting
magnetosphere, the physical properties general evolves towards that of the
normal pulsars. The above findings are consistent with previous analytical and
numerical results. The larger polar cap may corresponds to the hot spot during
magnetar outburst. In general, a rotating twisted magnetosphere has larger open
field line regions. The radio emission of magnetars and fast radio burst may
both originates in the larger and evolving open field line regions of
magnetars.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 首次在10-100 GeV能段探测到PSR B1259-63伽马射线双星，其能谱硬度与TeV能段一致，表明GeV发射是逆康普顿分量的上升尾部


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PSR B1259-63是一个经典的伽马射线双星，之前在GeV能段仅探测到几个GeV，TeV能谱外推高估了GeV通量，需要更深入的研究

Method: 使用超过17年的Fermi-LAT观测数据，分析-400到+100天（相对于近星点）的10 GeV到≳100 GeV能段数据

Result: 首次探测到PSR B1259-63在10-100 GeV能段的发射，能谱为硬幂律（Γ=1.9±0.1），通量水平与H.E.S.S.测量的TeV能段一致

Conclusion: GeV发射追踪了延伸到TeV能区的逆康普顿分量的上升尾部，在近星点前400天就探测到该源与现有理论模型难以协调

Abstract: PSR B1259-63 is a classical gamma-ray binary detected from radio to TeV
energies near periastron. In the GeV band, it had previously been detected only
up to a few GeV, with the extrapolation of the TeV spectrum overestimating the
measured GeV flux. Using over 17 years of Fermi-LAT observations, we report the
first detection of PSR B1259-63 in the 10 GeV to $\gtrsim 100$ GeV range, from
-400 to +100 days relative to periastron. The Fermi-LAT spectrum is well
described by a hard power law with index $\Gamma = 1.9 \pm 0.1$, and has a flux
level consistent with that measured at TeV energies by H.E.S.S. The apparent
transition from the hard Fermi-LAT spectrum to the softer TeV spectrum suggests
that the detected GeV emission traces the rising tail of the inverse-Compton
component extending into the TeV regime. We note that the detection of PSR
B1259-63 as early as -400 days before periastron is difficult to reconcile with
existing theoretical models.

TL;DR: 在EXO 0748-676 LMXB系统中首次探测到可能的紫外暴振荡信号，频率约552Hz，与中子星自旋频率一致，为测量中子星质量和半径提供了新途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线暴振荡可用于精确测量中子星质量和半径，从而约束核密度物质的物态方程。本研究旨在探索在紫外波段是否存在类似的振荡信号。

Method: 利用哈勃太空望远镜2003年的远紫外观测数据，分析EXO 0748-676系统的FUV暴发，通过模拟计算信号功率的随机噪声概率。

Result: 在FUV暴发上升阶段约8秒间隔内探测到候选振荡信号，脉冲轮廓接近正弦波，脉冲分数约16%，对应脉冲光度约8×10³³ erg/s。随机噪声概率为3.7%（整体）和0.3%（暴发上升阶段）。

Conclusion: 观测到的FUV暴振荡特性与现有模型存在严重矛盾，若未来观测确认此类信号，可能表明存在未知的相干发射过程。

Abstract: X-ray burst oscillations are quasi-coherent periodic signals at frequencies
close to the neutron star spin frequency. They are observed during
thermonuclear Type I X-ray bursts from a number of low-mass X-ray binaries
(LMXBs) hosting a fast-spinning, weakly magnetic neutron star. Besides
measuring the spin frequencies, burst oscillations hold the potential to
accurately measure neutron star mass and radius, thus providing constraints on
the equation of state of matter at nuclear densities. Based on far-ultraviolet
(FUV) observations of the X-ray binary EXO 0748-676 taken with the Hubble Space
Telescope in 2003, we report a possible indication of ultraviolet burst
oscillations at the neutron star spin frequency ($\sim$552 Hz), potentially the
first such case for an LMXB. The candidate signal is observed during an $\sim$8
s interval in the rising phase of an FUV burst, which occurred $\sim$4 s after
a Type I X-ray burst. Through simulations, we estimated that the probability of
detecting the observed signal power from pure random noise is 3.7$\%$,
decreasing to 0.3$\%$ if only the burst rise interval is considered, during
which X-ray burst oscillations had already been observed in this source. The
background-subtracted folded pulse profile of the candidate FUV oscillations in
the (120-160 nm) band is nearly sinusoidal with a $\sim$16$\%$ pulsed fraction,
corresponding to a pulsed luminosity of $\sim$8$\times$10$^{33}$ erg/s.
Interpreting the properties of this candidate FUV burst oscillations in the
light of current models for optical-ultraviolet emission from neutron star
LMXBs faces severe problems. If signals of this kind are confirmed in future
observations, they might point to an unknown coherent emission process as the
origin of the FUV burst oscillations observed in EXO 0748-676.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该论文首次同时考虑旋转和环形磁场对中子星基本模式的影响，建立了线性关系来量化f_F和f_{^2f}模式频率，证明通过探测这些模式可以约束旋转和磁场的联合效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前中子星旋转测量依赖电磁探测并假设均匀旋转，内部磁场推断因缺乏直接观测而模糊。通过引力波信号测量中子星激发的基本模式为解决这一问题提供了有前景的方法。

Method: 使用2D轴对称模拟，考虑旋转和环形磁场，构建f_F和f_{^2f}模式频率与恒星紧致度M/R、动能与结合能比T/|W|之间的准线性关系。

Result: 发现即使存在环形磁场，这些准线性关系仍然存在，其斜率取决于环形磁化常数K_m。测量频率比f_{^2f}/f_F可以推断T/|W|和最大磁场强度B_max。微分旋转仅导致与均匀旋转预测的微小偏差。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明可以通过中子星的基本模式推断其旋转和磁特性，为解释中子星的电磁和引力波信号提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals from neutron stars are shaped
by rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields. Determining these properties is
essential to interpret such signals, but current measurements are limited:
rotation estimates rely on electromagnetic detections and assume uniform
rotation, while inferring interior magnetic fields remains ambiguous due to a
lack of direct observations. Measuring the excited fundamental modes of neutron
stars in gravitational-wave signals offers a promising solution, as these modes
encode information about stellar composition, structure, and dynamics. Previous
studies have examined the individual effects of rotation and magnetic fields on
these modes, identifying magnetic suppression and establishing linear relations
for the frequencies of the fundamental $l=0$ quasi-radial mode $f_F$ and $l=2$
quadrupolar mode $f_{^2f}$. However, few have investigated the combined
influence of rotation and magnetic fields. Here, for the first time, we
consider both rotation and a toroidal magnetic field to construct linear
relations for quantifying $f_F$ and $f_{^2f}$, showing that their combined
effects can be constrained by detecting these modes. Using 2D axisymmetric
simulations, we demonstrate that quasi-linear relations between $f_F$,
$f_{^2f}$, stellar compactness $M/R$, and kinetic-to-binding energy ratio
$T/|W|$ persist even with a toroidal magnetic field. The slope of these
relations depends on the toroidal magnetization constant $K_\mathrm{m}$.
Additionally, measuring the frequency ratio $f_{^2f}/f_F$ enables inference of
$T/|W|$ and the maximum magnetic field strength $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{max}$.
Lastly, we show that differential rotation causes only minor deviations from
predictions for uniform rotation. Thus, this work demonstrates that rotational
and magnetic properties of neutron stars can be inferred from their fundamental
modes.

Conclusion: 静态平板冕不是X射线双星硬态的有利几何构型，未来将探索截断盘几何和流出冕作为替代方案

Abstract: The energy equilibrium between the corona and the underlying disk in a
two-phase accretion flow sets a lower limit on the achievable photon index. A
slab corona may not explain the hard state observations of X-ray binaries
(XRBs). We incorporate energy feedback to the accretion disk resulting from
illumination by an extended corona, and vice versa. The interaction between
these two components allows for the possibility of finding an energetically
self-consistent equilibrium solution for a given disk-corona system. We have
upgraded the existing Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, MONK, to incorporate
the interaction between the disk and the extended corona within the general
relativistic framework. We introduce an albedo parameter to specify the
fraction of the incident flux that is reflected by the disk, while the
remainder is absorbed and added to the intrinsic dissipation. Reflection is
modeled assuming a semi-infinite electron atmosphere. We find global
equilibrium solutions by iterating interaction between disk and extended slab
corona. A higher black hole spin, higher coronal temperature, and higher albedo
all lead to harder spectra. For typical coronal temperatures and disk albedo,
the lowest achievable photon index with a static slab corona fully covering the
disk is approximately 1.7-1.8. With the upgraded version of MONK, we are now
able to achieve global energy equilibrium for a given disk-corona system. This
approach holds significant potential for constraining the coronal geometry
using not only the observed flux but also polarization. A static slab does not
appear to be a favorable coronal geometry for the hard state of XRBs, even when
global energy balance is taken into account. In future work, we will explore
truncated disk geometries and outflowing coronae as potential alternatives.

TL;DR: 本文通过Gaia DR3数据分析高能X射线双星系统的特殊速度分布，发现Be/X射线双星和超巨星X射线双星具有不同的速度特征，表明它们经历了不同的演化历史。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高能X射线双星系统在超新星爆发后获得的特殊速度差异，以了解不同类别系统的演化历史差异。

Method: 使用Gaia DR3数据计算63个已知HMXBs的特殊速度，通过蒙特卡洛重采样估计不确定性，并进行Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验分析分布差异。

Result: BeXRBs倾向于V_pec < 40 km/s，而SgXRBs倾向于V_pec > 40 km/s，两类系统的速度分布存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 特殊速度大小可作为区分Be系统和超巨星系统的补充特征，反映了它们在超新星爆发时前身系统的不同性质。

Abstract: High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) are systems in which a neutron star or black
hole accretes material from a massive companion. HMXBs are expected to have
experienced a supernova in their evolution. The impulsive kick associated with
this event should affect the space velocity of the system in a way that depends
on the nature and state of the progenitor binary. Here, we test whether the
different evolutionary histories of HMXBs have left a detectable imprint on
their peculiar velocities ($V_{\rm pec}$). Using data from Gaia Data Release 3
(Gaia DR3), we first calculate the $V_{\rm pec}$ values for 63 well-known HMXBs
hosting a black hole or neutron star and estimate the associated uncertainties
via Monte Carlo re-sampling. We then analyse their distribution and check for
differences between classes. Overall, $V_{\rm pec}$ estimates extend up to 100
km s$^{-1}$, but with Be/X-ray binaries (BeXRBs) favouring $V_{\rm pec}$
$\lesssim 40$ km s$^{-1}$ and supergiant X-ray binaries (SgXRBs) favouring
$V_{\rm pec}$ $\gtrsim 40$ km s$^{-1}$. Based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S)
test, the null hypothesis that the peculiar velocities of both classes are
drawn from the same parent distribution can be robustly rejected, irrespective
of the background stellar velocity dispersion. Tests with binary population
synthesis demonstrate that SgXRBs typically have shorter orbital periods and
higher fractional mass loss than BeXRBs at supernova. We argue that the
magnitude of $V_{\rm pec}$ could be used as a complementary feature to
distinguish between Be and supergiant systems. These findings extend previous
inferences based on two-dimensional kinematics from Hipparcos, and may be
explained by the differing nature of the respective progenitors systems between
the source classes at the instant of supernova.

TL;DR: 使用MeerKAT望远镜研究黑洞X射线双星GRS1758-258的喷流结构，通过量热法估计喷流特性和星际介质性质，发现南北喷流瓣年龄差异和不同的ISM条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究吸积黑洞X射线双星的喷流与星际介质相互作用，了解物质和能量在吸积黑洞周围的输入输出过程，以及喷流对周围环境的反馈机制。

Method: 使用MeerKAT望远镜进行L波段观测（总曝光时间7小时），应用为活动星系核开发的量热法方法，分析喷流结构和星际介质特性，并与VLA档案数据比较测量自行运动。

Result: 探测到以弓形激波终止的喷流和反喷流，北瓣以同步辐射和韧致辐射为主，南瓣以热辐射为主。ISM密度10-40 cm⁻³，喷流瓣年龄6-51 kyr，时间平均喷流功率4.4×10³³-3.3×10³⁶ erg/s，测得北部喷流自行运动130 mas/yr。

Conclusion: GRS1758-258的喷流-ISM相互作用结构显示南北不同的ISM特性，喷流瓣较其他XRB系统更年轻，可能源于不同的喷流活动阶段，向环境传递的能量略低于其他系统。

Abstract: Jets from accreting black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRBs) are powerful
outflows that release a large fraction of the accretion energy to the
surrounding environment, providing a feedback mechanism that may alter the
interstellar medium (ISM) properties. Studying accretion and feedback together
enables estimates of matter and energy input/output around accreting BHs. We
focus on the extended jet structures of the BH-XRB GRS1758-258. First seen in
VLA data, these parsec-scale jets arise from jet-ISM interaction and show a
Z-shaped morphology. Using the MeerKAT telescope we observed GRS1758-258 in
L-band for a total exposure of 7 hr. Applying a calorimetry-based method
developed for AGN and later used for XRBs, we estimated the properties of the
jets and of the surrounding ISM. We detect a jet and counter-jet terminating in
bow-shocks. Within the northern jet lobe we identify synchrotron and
bremsstrahlung emission, while the southern lobe is dominated by thermal
emission. We measure ISM densities between 10-40 cm-3 across both jets,
slightly lower in the northern region. The estimated ages of the two lobes
range from 6-51 kyr. The time-averaged jet power lies between 4.4x10^33 and
3.3x10^36 erg/s, with differences between north and south likely due to
different local ISM conditions. Comparing new MeerKAT with archival VLA data,
we measured a proper motion of 130 mas/yr in a portion of the northern jet.
Jet-ISM interaction structures on both sides of GRS1758-258 reveal different
ISM properties. The comparison between these structures and those from other
XRBs suggests that the lobes in GRS1758-258 are younger and may result from
different jet activity phases. The time-averaged energy transferred to the
environment is slightly lower than in other XRBs, consistent with the younger
age of the lobes in GRS1758-258 relative to those of other systems.

Method: 采用结合3D广义相对论磁流体动力学和数值相对论的数值模拟方法，模拟等质量平行自旋双黑洞的晚期旋近、并合及并合后初期阶段

Result: 发现热光子功率在并合过程中主要来自强激波；热光子和喷流功率在时间上紧密相关；辐射功率在并合前逐渐减小，但在并合时急剧跃升至噪声平台

Conclusion: 这种独特的光变曲线特征有助于识别超大质量黑洞并合事件，无论是否伴随引力波探测

Abstract: Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas,
merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong
multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal
gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets.
Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger,
and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the
same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular
momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during
the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong
shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured
accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find
that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in
time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated
in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but
jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should
aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without
accompanying gravitational wave detections.

Result: 发现电子温度从激波前沿(0.15keV)向内部(0.19keV)逐渐升高，空间尺度6角分(1.27pc)；电离时间尺度显著高于基于周围物质电子密度和激波速度的估计值。

Conclusion: 温度分布可用修正Sedov辐射冷却模型解释，电离时间尺度异常表明存在湍流导致的内层多重等离子体组分混合，这有助于理解无碰撞激波的物理过程。

Abstract: The physical processes behind astrophysical collisionless shocks, such as
thermal relaxation and ionization after shock passage, remain poorly
understood. To investigate these processes, we analyze the northeastern region
of the Cygnus Loop with XMM-Newton. The electron temperature is found to
increase towards the interior of the remnant ranging from 0.15-0.19 keV energy
range within a spatial scale of 6 arcmin (or 1.27 pc at a distance of 725 pc)
from the shock front. This can be explained well by a modified Sedov solution
with radiative cooling. We also show that the ionization timescales determined
from our spectroscopy are significantly larger than those estimated based on
the electron density of the surrounding materials and the shock velocity. This
excess can be qualitatively explained by a mixing of inner multiple plasma
components with different ionization states due to turbulence.

Abstract: An extremely energetic muon has been recently detected by the Cubic Kilometre
Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT), indicating the observation of a neutrino with the
estimated energy of $\left( 2.2^{+5.7}_{-1.0} \right)\times 10^{17}$~eV. Radio
blazar PMN~J0606$-$0724, not detected in gamma rays, is located within the
reported error region of the neutrino arrival direction, and was flaring at the
time of the event. Here we demonstrate that the neutrino could be produced in a
photohadronic interaction in its radio core. The necessary proton power is of
order of the source's photon luminosity, and protons can be accelerated to the
required energies in the core, while high-energy gamma rays cannot leave the
source because of intense production of electron-positron pairs. Expected
contribution of the population of similar flaring sources matches
non-observation of energetic events by other neutrino telescopes.

Result: 使用错误模型分析信号会导致参数推断偏差，例如将(4,4)太阳质量的玻色子双星误识别为(8,2)太阳质量；而使用包含自旋诱导多极矩和潮汐形变效应的正确模型能成功恢复真实质量。

Conclusion: 波形模型的准确性对于在低质量间隙中执行可靠的致密天体区分测试至关重要，正确包含物理效应的模型能避免参数推断偏差。

Abstract: As the compact binary catalog continues to grow rapidly, developing and
refining tests to probe the nature of compact objects is essential for a
comprehensive understanding of both the observed data and the underlying
astrophysics of the binary population. We investigate the effectiveness of
spin-induced multipole moments (SIQM) and tidal deformability measurements in
distinguishing lower mass-gap black hole (BH) binaries from non-BH binaries
with different mass and spin configurations. We perform model-agnostic tests on
binary BH (BBH) simulations using full Bayesian inference, evaluating the
independent and joint measurability of SIQM and tidal parameters across the
parameter space. We extend the analysis to simulations of self-interacting
spinning boson stars, using synthetic signals that exhibit (a) both SIQM and
tidal effects and (b) each effect individually. For case (a), recovery is
performed using (i) a BBH model, (ii) a model incorporating both SIQM and tidal
effects, and (iii) models including either SIQM or tidal effects. For case (b),
we employ (i) a BBH model and (ii) models incorporating either SIQM or tidal
effects, consistent with the injection. Simulations employ TaylorF2 waveform
model and consider binaries in the low mass gap with varying spin magnitudes.
We find that employing an incorrect model to analyze the signal can lead to
biases in parameter inference. Notably, when analyzing a simulated binary boson
star-like signal with component masses $\rm{(4, 4) \, M_{\odot}}$ using a BBH
model, the system is incorrectly identified as having masses $\rm{(8, 2) \,
M_{\odot}}$. In contrast, using the correct recovery model that includes both
SIQM and tidal deformability effects successfully recovers the true masses,
highlighting the significance of waveform model accuracy in performing reliable
distinguishability tests for compact objects in the low-mass gap.

Abstract: IceAct is an array of imaging air Cherenkov telescopes located at the ice
surface above the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Each telescope features a
silicon photomultiplier based 61 pixel camera and a Fresnel-lens as imaging
optic, resulting in a 12-degree field of view. The design is optimized to be
operated in harsh environments, particularly at the South Pole. The setup will
consist of seven telescopes in a so-called fly's eye configuration, increasing
the field of view to 36^\circ, and an additional telescope 200m apart for
stereoscopic observations. Rigorous testing procedures have been performed
before deployment to ensure that operation under these conditions is possible,
e.g. night sky observations and cold temperature tests. Furthermore, on-site
calibrations are used to verify the accuracy and reliability of the
installation. We derive the geometric alignment of each IceAct telescope by
comparing the directional reconstruction of muons measured with IceCube to the
corresponding primary particle direction reconstruction from IceAct. This
contribution presents these testing procedures. Additionally, we present the
on-site alignment calibration, including a Graph Neural Network reconstruction
for the primary particle direction in IceAct, verification on Monte Carlo
simulation, and the application to a commissioning dataset.

Abstract: NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) aims to achieve starlight
suppression to the $10^{-10}$ level for the detection and spectral
characterization of Earth-like exoplanets. Broadband ozone absorption features
are key biosignatures that appear in the 200-400nm near-ultraviolet (UV)

brings with it a number of challenges, including tighter requirements on
wavefront sensing and control, optical surface quality, scattered light, and
polarization aberrations, among other things. We aim to partially quantify and
address these challenges with a combination of modeling, high-resolution
metrology to the scales required for UV coronagraphy, and ultimately a
demonstration of UV coronagraphy on the Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB)

Motivation: 传统基于低通滤波的恒星晕减法会导致发射线的自减和邻近连续谱的变形，需要一种能更好保留光谱特征的新方法。

Abstract: Context. Medium-resolution IFS, such as MUSE at the VLT, are equipped to
detect the emission lines of faint accreting companions when associated with
dedicated stellar halo subtraction methods. We recently proposed a new approach
based on polynomial modulations of a stellar spectrum estimate across the field
of view, with orthogonal polynomials and lines masking. Aims. We seek to
highlight and quantify analytically and on real data the benefits of this new
approach over the one classically used, particularly with regard to distortions
of the extracted spectra. Methods. We carried out analytical calculations based
on simple toy models. Simulations of the most extreme situations identified
were used to highlight these problems and corrections. Archival VLT/MUSE data
of the young PDS70 and HTLup systems were used to vet the detection and
characterization capabilities using on-sky observations. New images of the
YSES1 planetary system were used to further illustrate the gains. Results. We
show that the state-of-the-art method, based on low-pass filtering, can lead to
the self-subtraction of the emission lines and modify the neighboring continua.
We show that the proposed technique corrects these characterization problems,
while maintaining the same detection capabilities. The two protoplanets PDS70 b
and c were detected with 5sigma significance. The Halpha line estimate of the
HTLup B stellar companion was improved by ~30% for the integrated flux and by
~8% for the 10%-width. As for YSES1 b, we found it uniquely displays a
combination of Halpha, Hbeta, CaII H&K triplet, and HeI lines in emission.
Conclusions. The proposed method better preserves the spectral information,
notably the emission line fluxes and profiles, while achieving similar
detection performance. Based on a linear and parametric approach, it can be
extended and/or combined with additional faint signal search algorithms.

Abstract: The planned IceCube-Gen2 radio neutrino detector at the South Pole will
enhance the detection of cosmic ultra-high-energy neutrinos. It is crucial to
utilize the available time until construction to optimize the detector design.
A fully differentiable pipeline, from signal generation to detector response,
would allow for the application of gradient descent techniques to explore the
parameter space of the detector. In our work, we focus on the aspect of signal
generation, and propose a modularized deep learning architecture to generate
radio signals from in-ice neutrino interactions conditioned on the shower
energy and viewing angle. The model is capable of generating differentiable
signals with amplitudes spanning multiple orders of magnitude, as well as
consistently producing signals corresponding to the same underlying event for
different viewing angles. The modularized approach ensures physical consistency
of the samples and leads to advantageous computational properties when using
the model as part of a bigger optimization pipeline.

Motivation: 偏振测量在射电干涉测量中已很成熟，但在可见光和近红外波段由于复杂光学光束路径引入的显著时变双折射而具有挑战性。需要准确表征CHARA阵列中的仪器偏振效应。

Method: 使用Jones矩阵形式建立了描述阵列中二向色性和延迟的全面模型，通过应用于非偏振校准源推导出MIRC-X和MYSTIC仪器的参数。

Result: 实现了MIRC-X在可见度比±3.4%和差分相位±1.4度的校准精度，MYSTIC分别为±5.9%和±2.4度。仪器不确定性低于空间分辨源的固有偏振，证明CHARA能够进行高精度偏振测量。

Conclusion: CHARA阵列现在能够实现对天体物理目标固有偏振的高精度测量，这对于研究YSOs的红外发射机制和AGB星周围的尘埃形成细节具有重要意义。

Abstract: Polarimetric data provide key insights into infrared emission mechanisms in
the inner disks of YSOs and the details of dust formation around AGB stars.
While polarization measurements are well-established in radio interferometry,
they remain challenging at visible and near-infrared due to the significant
time-variable birefringence introduced by the complex optical beamtrain. In
this study, we characterize instrumental polarization effects within the
optical path of the CHARA Array, focusing on the H-band MIRC-X and K-band
MYSTIC beam combiners. Using Jones matrix formalism, we developed a
comprehensive model describing diattenuation and retardance across the array.
By applying this model to an unpolarized calibrator, we derived the
instrumental parameters for both MIRC-X and MYSTIC. Our results show
differential diattenuation consistent with >= 97% reflectivity per
aluminum-coated surface at 45 deg incidence. The differential retardance
exhibits small wavelength-dependent variations, in some cases larger than we
expected. Notably, telescope W2 exhibits a significantly larger phase shift in
the Coude path, attributable to a fixed aluminum mirror (M4) used in place of
deformable mirrors present on the other telescopes during the observing run. We
also identify misalignments in the LiNbO_3 birefringent compensator plates on
S1 (MIRC-X) and W2 (MYSTIC). After correcting for night-to-night offsets, we
achieve calibration accuracies of $\pm$ 3.4% in visibility ratio and $\pm$ 1.4
deg in differential phase for MIRC-X, and $\pm$ 5.9% and $\pm$ 2.4 deg,
respectively, for MYSTIC. Given that the differential intrinsic polarization of
spatially resolved sources, such as AGB stars and YSOs, typically greater than
these instrumental uncertainties, our results demonstrate that CHARA is now
capable of achieving high-accuracy measurements of intrinsic polarization in
astrophysical targets.
