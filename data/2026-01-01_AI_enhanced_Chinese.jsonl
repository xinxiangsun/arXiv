The Antarctic region, with several months of continuous dark nights annually, is an ideal site for time-domain astronomical observations. The Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Project aims to deploy a fleet of small telescopes, adopting an array observation model to conduct time-domain optical observations in Antarctica, featuring wide-sky coverage, high-cadence sampling, long-period staring, and simultaneous multi-band measurements. Considering the severe challenges optical telescopes face in Antarctica, including extremely low temperatures, unattended operation, and limited power supply and network transmission, we have designed and developed the Antarctic TianMu prototype telescope based on drift-scan charge-coupled device technology. In October 2022, our prototype (with an aperture of 18 cm), named AT-Proto was transported to Zhongshan Station in Antarctica aboard China's 39th Antarctic Research Expedition. It has since operated stably and reliably in the frigid environment for over two years, demonstrating the significant advantages of this technology in polar astronomical observations.

It utilizes the exceptional observing conditions in Antarctica to conduct high-cadence time-domain sky surveys. At present, we have successfully developed an 18-cm aperture Antarctic TianMu prototype, which has been deployed at Zhongshan Station in Antarctica for two consecutive years of trouble-free observations, during which more than 300,000 original images were obtained. This paper systematically outlines the commissioning data of the prototype telescope in 2023, the primary data processing pipeline, and the preliminary data products. The core pipeline encompasses four key stages: Data preprocessing, instrumental effect correction, astrometric solution, and full-field stellar photometry. Here, we release the 2023 data products, which specifically include reduced image data and a photometric catalog, for which, preliminary analyses demonstrate robust performance. Using Gaia Data Release 3 as a reference catalog, the astrometric precision, quantified by the root mean square of positional errors, is determined to be better than approximately 2 arcseconds, validating the observational capabilities of the system. For a 30-second exposure, the detection limit in the G-band is achieved at 15.00~mag, with a detection threshold of 1.5~$\u03c3$. The photometric errors are below 0.1~mag for the majority of stars brighter than 14.00~mag. Furthermore, it improves significantly, reaching better than 0.01~mag for most stars brighter than 11.00~mag and 12.00~mag when employing the adaptive aperture photometry and point spread function photometry methods, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5357\u6781\u5929\u76ee\u5de1\u5929\u539f\u578b\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u5728\u4e2d\u5c71\u7ad9\u6210\u529f\u8fd0\u884c\u4e24\u5e74\uff0c\u83b7\u5f9730\u4e07\u5f20\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c2023\u5e74\u6570\u636e\u4ea7\u54c1\u5305\u62ec\u5904\u7406\u540e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6d4b\u5149\u661f\u8868\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8e2\u89d2\u79d2\uff0cG\u6ce2\u6bb5\u63a2\u6d4b\u6781\u965015\u7b49\uff0c\u4eae\u661f\u6d4b\u5149\u8bef\u5dee\u4f18\u4e8e0.01\u661f\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u5357\u6781\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u5f00\u5c55\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5de1\u5929\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5357\u6781\u5929\u76ee\u5de1\u5929\u539f\u578b\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u5357\u6781\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u57df\u5149\u5b66\u5de1\u5929\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d118\u5398\u7c73\u53e3\u5f84\u5357\u6781\u5929\u76ee\u539f\u578b\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u5357\u6781\u4e2d\u5c71\u7ad9\u8fdb\u884c\u8fde\u7eed\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u4eea\u5668\u6548\u5e94\u6821\u6b63\u3001\u5929\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u89e3\u7b97\u548c\u5168\u573a\u6052\u661f\u6d4b\u5149\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u8fd0\u884c\u4e24\u5e74\u65e0\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u8d85\u8fc730\u4e07\u5f20\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u30022023\u5e74\u6570\u636e\u4ea7\u54c1\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u4ee5Gaia DR3\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8e2\u89d2\u79d2\uff1b30\u79d2\u66dd\u5149G\u6ce2\u6bb5\u63a2\u6d4b\u6781\u965015\u7b49\uff1b14\u7b49\u4ee5\u4e0a\u6052\u661f\u6d4b\u5149\u8bef\u5dee\u5c0f\u4e8e0.1\u661f\u7b49\uff1b11-12\u7b49\u4eae\u661f\u6d4b\u5149\u8bef\u5dee\u4f18\u4e8e0.01\u661f\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5357\u6781\u5929\u76ee\u539f\u578b\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u5357\u6781\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u5b66\u5de1\u5929\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u8fbe\u5230\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5357\u6781\u5de1\u5929\u9879\u76ee\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Press", "summary": "From NBODY1 to NBODY6 : The Growth of an Industry is the title of a 1999 invited review by Sverre Aarseth, for Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (PASP). I took this as an inspiration for the title of this paper; it describes how Sverres NBODY Industry has further grown since 90s of the previous century, and how it is further flourishing and hopefully developing, in his spirit, even after the sad news of his passing away reached us. My contact and friendship with Sverre started a few decades ago being sent to Cambridge to learn NBODY5, counting input parameters, and learning about the fact that even a sophisticated code (which had already at that time quite a history) requires permanent maintenance and bug fixes. Managed by Sverre, who relentlessly ran his code and responded to the widely spread crowd of customer colleagues. There has been a phase of massive and fast development and improvements due to vectorization, parallelization, GRAPE and GPU acceleration, and Sverre has been always on top of it if not ahead, but also fully adopting ideas of collaborators, once they tested well.

Traditional constraints on the equation of state rely on Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff modelling and comparison with multimessenger observations, but machine learning provides a complementary pathway by learning composition dependent patterns directly from astrophysically accessible observables. This work presents a compact supervised learning framework for EOS family classification using stellar properties derived from TOV modelling, asteroseismology, and gravitational wave descriptors. A labelled dataset of neutron star configurations spanning four EOS families (nucleonic, strange matter, dark matter admixed, and hyperonic) is constructed using seven input features: gravitational mass, radius, fundamental f mode frequency, quadrupole moment, redshift, damping time, and characteristic strain. A multilayer perceptron is trained to infer the underlying matter composition. On a held out test set, the classifier achieves an accuracy of 97.4 percent with strong class wise precision and recall. Permutation based feature importance analysis shows that oscillation related quantities, especially the f mode frequency and damping time, dominate the discriminatory power, while mass and radius provide secondary support. Residual misclassifications occur in physically intuitive regions where different EOS families produce partially overlapping macroscopic signatures. These results show that lightweight neural models can reliably identify EOS family fingerprints from a modest set of observables, providing a reproducible baseline for future extensions incorporating Bayesian uncertainty and observational posteriors from NICER and gravitational wave events.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u4ece7\u4e2a\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7269\u8d28\u7ec4\u6210\uff08\u6838\u5b50\u3001\u5947\u5f02\u7269\u8d28\u3001\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6df7\u5408\u3001\u8d85\u5b50\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523097.4%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u5fae\u89c2\u7ec4\u6210\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfTOV\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u7a0b\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u8865\u5145\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u6210\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2aEOS\u5bb6\u65cf\uff08\u6838\u5b50\u3001\u5947\u5f02\u7269\u8d28\u3001\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6df7\u5408\u3001\u8d85\u5b50\uff09\u7684\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u914d\u7f6e\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u75287\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u5f15\u529b\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u534a\u5f84\u3001\u57fa\u672cf\u6a21\u9891\u7387\u3001\u56db\u6781\u77e9\u3001\u7ea2\u79fb\u3001\u963b\u5c3c\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u5e94\u53d8\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u8d28\u7ec4\u6210\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fbe\u523097.4%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5217\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u632f\u8361\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662ff\u6a21\u9891\u7387\u548c\u963b\u5c3c\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u534a\u5f84\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b21\u8981\u652f\u6301\u3002\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u7269\u7406\u76f4\u89c2\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4e0d\u540cEOS\u5bb6\u65cf\u4ea7\u751f\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u9760\u8bc6\u522bEOS\u5bb6\u65cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u53ef\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548cNICER\u53ca\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u540e\u9a8c\u3002"}}

We conducted observations targeting 30 unidentified sources from the 4FGL-DR3 Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) catalog, selected for their pulsar-like $\u03b3$-ray properties. Extending to Galactic latitudes as low as $\\pm3^{\\circ}$, this survey reaches closer to the Galactic plane than its predecessor survey, the COmpact BInary PULsar SEarch (COBIPULSE).

Primary Thematic Area: Heliophysics", "summary": "Solar flares are the largest energy-release events in the Solar System, allowing us to study fundamental physical phenomena under extreme conditions. Those include magnetic reconnection, particle acceleration, radiation transport, and various plasma physics processes, all of which occur throughout the heliosphere and rest of the Universe. Flares and eruptive events are also components of geo-effective space weather. Their impacts from a space weather perspective are numerous, such as harm to satellites, disruption to GPS, communications and power systems, and impacts on passenger air travel. A comprehensive understanding of solar flares is therefore not just a compelling science problem, but also important for national security and infrastructure. This white paper (WP) addresses critical open science questions related to solar flares. Key observations and capabilities required to make significant advancements over the coming decade are identified. The UK has a robust and vibrant solar flare community.

The disk viscosity is assumed to vary radially as $\u03bd\\propto r^{n}$. We derive solutions for three types of boundary conditions applied at the inner radius $r_{\\rm in}$: (i) zero torque, (ii) zero mass accretion rate, and (iii) finite torque and finite accretion rate, and investigate the time evolution of a disk with an initial surface density represented by a Dirac-delta function. The mass accretion rate at the inner radius decays with time as $t^{-3/2}$ for $n = 1$ at late times in the absence of winds under the zero-torque condition, consistent with Lynden-Bell \\& Pringle (1974), while the presence of winds leads to a steeper decay. All boundary conditions yield identical asymptotic time evolution for the accretion and wind mass-loss rates, though their radial profiles differ near $r_{\\rm in}$. Applying our solutions to protoplanetary disks, we find that the disk follows distinct evolutionary tracks in the accretion rate-disk mass plane depending on $\u03c8$, a dimensionless parameter that regulates the strength of the vertical stress driving the wind, with the disk lifetime decreasing as $\u03c8$ increases due to enhanced wind-driven mass loss. The inner boundary condition influences the evolution for $\u03c8< 1$ but becomes negligible at higher $\u03c8$, indicating that strong magnetically driven winds dominate and limit mass inflow near the boundary.

As FRB signals propagate through ionized media, they experience frequency-dependent delays quantified by the dispersion measure (DM), a key parameter for inferring source distances and local plasma conditions. Accurate DM estimation is therefore essential for characterizing FRB sources and testing physical models, yet current dedispersion methods can be computationally intensive and prone to human bias. In this proof-of-concept study, we develop and benchmark three deep-learning architectures, a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), a fine-tuned ResNet-50, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, for automated DM estimation. All models are trained and validated on a large set of synthetic FRB dynamic spectra generated using CHIME/FRB-like specifications. The hybrid CNN-LSTM achieves the highest accuracy and stability while maintaining low computational cost across the investigated DM range.

Conventional methods rely on empirical features like hardness ratios and reliable localization, which are not always precisely available during early detection. We developed the Lightweight Unified Neural Classifier for High-energy Transients (LUNCH) - an end-to-end deep-learning framework that performs general transient classification directly from raw multi-band light curves, eliminating the need for background subtraction or source localization. Its dual-scale architecture fuses long- and short-scale temporal evolution adaptively. Evaluated on 15 years of Fermi/GBM triggers, the optimal model achieves 97.23% accuracy when trained on complete energy spectra. A lightweight version using only three broad energy bands retains 95.07% accuracy, demonstrating that coarse spectral information fused with temporal context enables robust discrimination. The system significantly outperforms the GBM in-flight classifier on three months of independent test data. Feature visualization reveals well-separated class clusters, confirming physical interpretability.

We investigate how key parameters like the magnetization $\u03c3_0$ shape the broadband spectral energy distribution by regulating the electron distribution and magnetic field strength. The overall spectrum typically comprises two components: synchrotron radiation peaking at $E_{\\rm p}$ with a low-energy spectral index $\u03b1$ between -1 and -1.5, and an SSC component peaking at $E_{\\rm ssc}$. At high energies, Klein-Nishina suppression causes an exponential cutoff. The flux ratio Y between these components is critical: when Y is small, the SSC peak can be suppressed. Spectral features of the synchrotron component reveal the underlying physical conditions: harder spectra with $\u03b1\\sim-1$ indicate a large Y parameter and strong KN suppression. We find a positive correlation between Y and $\u03c3_0$, contrasting with internal shock model predictions.

It aims to minimize the reliance on external catalogs and find TDE candidates from pure light curves, which is more suitable for finding TDEs in faint and distant galaxies. \\texttt{TTC} consists of two key modules that can work independently: (1) A light curve parametric fitting module and (2) a Transformer (\\texttt{Mgformer})-based classification network. The training of the latter module and evaluation for each module utilize a light curve dataset of 7413 spectroscopically classified transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The \\texttt{Mgformer}-based module is superior in performance and flexibility. Its representative recall and precision values are 0.79 and 0.76, respectively, and can be modified by adjusting the threshold. It can also efficiently find TDE candidates within 30 days from the first detection.

The source exhibits pronounced spectral and temporal variability, indicative of transitions between different accretion regimes in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole. The earlier reported soft excess is re-examined within a uniform, physically motivated multi-epoch framework. We confirm the presence of this soft excess in the 2009 observation, where it is well described by a warm, extended Comptonizing corona with $kT_{\\rm e,warm} \\sim 0.26$~keV and a radial extent of $R_{\\rm warm} \\sim 30~r_g$. In subsequent epochs, the soft excess is not statistically significant, possibly due to a combination of enhanced ionized absorption, intrinsic weakening of the warm Comptonizing region, or partial truncation of the inner disc. A strong correlation between the soft and hard X-ray fluxes suggests a common physical origin for both components, likely within a multi-layered Comptonizing structure that evolved into a compact and thermally stable corona after 2013. The observed spectral variability, together with changes in the Fe~K$\u03b1$ line strength, reflects the evolving coronal geometry and accretion flow dynamics. Variations in the intrinsic column density ($N_H$) further indicate that Mrk~1040 is embedded within a clumpy, dynamically variable absorber responding to changes in the accretion rate. Using the TCAF model, we estimate the black hole mass as $M_{\\rm BH} = (4.50 \\pm 1.62) \\times 10^7~M_\\odot$, consistent with previous estimates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9Seyfert 1\u578b\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838Mrk 1040\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8615\u5e74\u591a\u5386\u5143X\u5c04\u7ebf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5438\u79ef\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u8f6f\u8d85\u91cf\u57282009\u5e74\u5b58\u5728\u4f46\u540e\u7eed\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u8f6f\u786cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u901a\u91cf\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u8868\u660e\u5171\u540c\u7269\u7406\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e3a(4.50\u00b11.62)\u00d710\u2077\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Mrk 1040\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5438\u79ef\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u65e5\u5195\u51e0\u4f55\u6f14\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f6f\u8d85\u91cf\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8d77\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282009\u5e74\u81f32024\u5e74\uff08\u7ea615\u5e74\uff09\u7684\u591a\u5386\u5143X\u5c04\u7ebf\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u91c7\u7528TCAF\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u8f6f\u8d85\u91cf\u3001Fe K\u03b1\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u67f1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u8ba42009\u5e74\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8f6f\u8d85\u91cf\uff0c\u7531\u6e29\u6696\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u5316\u65e5\u5195\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b\u540e\u7eed\u5386\u5143\u4e2d\u8f6f\u8d85\u91cf\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u8f6f\u786cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u901a\u91cf\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff1bFe K\u03b1\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u67f1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u65e5\u5195\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u6d41\u6f14\u5316\uff1b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e3a(4.50\u00b11.62)\u00d710\u2077\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Mrk 1040\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5438\u79ef\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u8f6f\u786cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u53ef\u80fd\u8d77\u6e90\u4e8e\u591a\u5c42\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5438\u79ef\u6d41\u5468\u56f4\u5b58\u5728\u56e2\u5757\u72b6\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5438\u6536\u4f53\uff0c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1--100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will provide a platform for future UV instruments capable of resolving these scales.

Previous studies have hinted at a possible linear correlation between the hard X-ray and high-energy neutrino emission in active galactic nuclei. New \\textit{NuSTAR} observations, first presented here, reveal that blazar PKS 1424+240, located within a prominent IceCube neutrino hotspot, is far fainter in hard X-rays than expected from this trend. Motivated by this apparent ambiguity, we identify the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 5610, also coincident with the hotspot, whose unabsorbed hard X-ray flux exceeds that of PKS 1424+240 by about an order of magnitude. When the local IceCube neutrino flux is apportioned between the two AGN in proportion to their hard X-ray emission, both align with the previously suggested X-ray-neutrino correlation. This suggests that certain IceCube hotspots may be unresolved blends of multiple AGN, and supports a multimessenger scenario in which high-energy neutrinos and hard X-rays originate from the same hadronic interactions, with the X-ray emission produced through cascade reprocessing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9bIceCube\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u70ed\u70b9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u591a\u4e2a\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u7684\u672a\u5206\u8fa8\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u80fd\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u548c\u786cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6765\u81ea\u76f8\u540c\u5f3a\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u591a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u80fd\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u548c\u4ea7\u751f\u673a\u5236\u662f\u591a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u7684\u786cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u65b0\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528NuSTAR\u89c2\u6d4b\u4f4d\u4e8eIceCube\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u70ed\u70b9\u5185\u7684\u8000\u53d8\u4f53PKS 1424+240\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u786cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6bd4\u9884\u671f\u6697\u5f31\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u540c\u4e00\u70ed\u70b9\u5185\u7684\u90bb\u8fd1\u585e\u5f17\u7279\u661f\u7cfbNGC 5610\uff0c\u5176\u786cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u901a\u91cf\u6bd4PKS 1424+240\u9ad8\u7ea6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u901a\u91cf\u6309\u786cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u53d1\u5c04\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u6309\u786cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u53d1\u5c04\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u901a\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u90fd\u7b26\u5408\u5148\u524d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf-\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u67d0\u4e9bIceCube\u70ed\u70b9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u591a\u4e2a\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u7684\u672a\u5206\u8fa8\u6df7\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u80fd\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u548c\u786cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6765\u81ea\u76f8\u540c\u5f3a\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u591a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dX\u5c04\u7ebf\u53d1\u5c04\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea7\u8054\u518d\u5904\u7406\u4ea7\u751f\u3002\u67d0\u4e9bIceCube\u70ed\u70b9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u591a\u4e2a\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u7684\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u6765\u6e90\u3002"}}

Chibueze, B. Bi, M. Boettcher, F. Jankovsky, A. Luashvili", "summary": "PKS 0346-27 is a Low Synchrotron Peaked (LSP) blazar at redshift 0.991. The very-high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) spectra of blazars are always affected by $\u03b3\u03b3$ absorption by the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) and subsequently, no blazars have been detected in VHE $\u03b3$-rays at redshifts exceeding 1. Extending the redshift range of VHE-detected blazars to $z \\gtrsim 1$ will yield insights into the cosmological evolution of both the VHE blazar population and the EBL. This is the goal of a target-of-opportunity (ToO) programme by H.E.S.S. to observe flaring high-redshift ($z \\gtrsim 1$) blazars. We report on H.E.S.S. ToO and multi-wavelength observations of the blazar PKS\\,0346$-$27. Along with H.E.S.S., simultaneous data from {\\it Fermi}-LAT, {\\it Swift} (XRT and UVOT), and ATOM have been analysed and modelled using single-zone leptonic and hadronic models. PKS~0346-27 has been detected by H.E.S.S at a significance of 6.3$\u03c3$ during one night, on 3 November 2021, while for other nights before and after this day, upper limits on the VHE flux are determined. No evidence for intra-night $\u03b3$-ray variability has been found. A flare in high-energy (HE, $E > 100$~MeV) $\u03b3$-rays detected by {\\it Fermi}-LAT preceded the H.E.S.S. detection by 2 days. A fit with a single-zone emission model to the contemporaneous spectral energy distribution during the detection night was possible with a proton-synchrotron-dominated hadronic model, requiring a proton-kinetic-energy-dominated jet power temporarily exceeding the source's Eddington limit, although alternative (e.g. multi-zone) models can not be ruled out. A one-zone leptonic model is, in principle, also able to fit the flare-state SED, however, requiring implausible parameter choices, in particular, extreme Doppler and bulk Lorentz factors of $\\gtrsim 80$.", "AI": {"tldr": "PKS 0346-27\u6210\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u7ea2\u79fb\u63a5\u8fd11\u7684\u751a\u9ad8\u80fd\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\uff0cH.E.S.S.\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u5176\u8000\u53d1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f3a\u5b50\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u6781\u9650\u7684\u55b7\u6d41\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u751a\u9ad8\u80fd\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u7ea2\u79fb\u6269\u5c55\u5230z\u22731\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u751a\u9ad8\u80fd\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u79cd\u7fa4\u548c\u6cb3\u5916\u80cc\u666f\u5149\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528H.E.S.S.\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u673a\u4f1a\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Fermi-LAT\u3001Swift\uff08XRT\u548cUVOT\uff09\u548cATOM\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u540c\u65f6\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u533a\u8f7b\u5b50\u548c\u5f3a\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u62df\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "PKS 0346-27\u57282021\u5e7411\u67083\u65e5\u88abH.E.S.S.\u4ee56.3\u03c3\u663e\u8457\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\uff0c\u5176\u524d2\u5929Fermi-LAT\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u9ad8\u80fd\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u8000\u53d1\u3002\u5355\u533a\u5f3a\u5b50\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u62df\u5408\u8000\u53d1\u6001SED\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6682\u65f6\u8d85\u8fc7\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u6781\u9650\u7684\u55b7\u6d41\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u5355\u533a\u8f7b\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u6781\u7aef\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u56e0\u5b50\u227380\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7ea2\u79fb\u63a5\u8fd11\u7684\u751a\u9ad8\u80fd\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f3a\u5b50\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u6781\u9650\u7684\u55b7\u6d41\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u80fd\u6392\u9664\u591a\u533a\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u66ff\u4ee3\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

Ferreira da Silva"], "title": "Improved lanthanide constraints for the kilonova AT 2017gfo", "comment": "Submitted to MNRAS; comments welcome", "summary": "Spectroscopic observations of the kilonova AT 2017gfo provide a unique opportunity to identify signatures from individual heavy elements freshly synthesised via the {\\it r}-process, the nucleosynthetic channel responsible for producing $\\sim$half of all trans-iron-group elements. Limitations in the available atomic data have historically hampered comprehensive line identification studies; however, renewed interest has led to the generation of improved (more complete and accurately calibrated) line lists for {\\it r}-process species. Here we demonstrate the utility of such data, by exploiting newly generated line lists for the lanthanides to model the photospheric-phase 3.4d X-shooter spectrum of AT 2017gfo with the radiative transfer tool \\textsc{tardis}. We find the data can only be reproduced by invoking a substantially diminished lanthanide mass fraction ($X_{\\textsc{ln}}$) than that proposed by previous studies.

Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "GRB 161117A is a long-duration GRB with three main overlapping peaks. By analyzing the time-resolved spectra of its data observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi mission, we find that the spectral evolution shows a transition from thermal (single BB) to hybrid (PL$+$BB), and finally to non-thermal (Band and CPL) emissions. Such a transition suggests that the jet composition of GRB 161117A should be changed from a fireball to a Poynting-flux-dominated jet. The bulk Lorentz factor ($\u0393_{\\rm ph}$), radii ($R_{\\rm ph}$ and $R_{0}$), magnetization factor at the central engine ($\u03c3_0$), and dimensionless entropy ($\u03b7$) of the outflow can be inferred by invoking the observed quasi-thermal component within two models (e.g., pure fireball and hybrid). It is found that $\u0393_{\\rm ph}$ seems to be tracking with the light curve, and $R_{0}$ remains a constant at $\\sim$ $10^{8}$ cm. The low magnetization ($1+\u03c3_0 \\sim$ 1) and high dimensionless entropy ($\u03b7\\gg$ 1) during the first seven time-intervals suggest to be a pure fireball outflow. Moreover, we also estimate the lower limit of magnetization parameter at the photosphere radius ($\u03c3_{\\rm ph}\\sim 1.4$ and 0.75) for late phase via the non-thermal spectra, and it indicates that the particle acceleration mechanism is dominated by internal shocks rather than magnetic dissipation processes.

We have constructed three distinct classes of an ensemble of agnostic equation of state by speed of sound parametrisation. Bayesian inference is then employed to constrain the EoS construction parameters-namely, the squared speed of sound and chemical potential at each interpolation segment-using the observational data. Both the NICER and GW constraints hint towards a smoother EoS where PT occurs late, significantly reducing the maximum mass of NS. Also, the maximum-mass and maximum-compact sequences are distinctly different, as the former allows for the maximally stiff EoS to maximise the star mass. In contrast, the latter prefers a softer low-density and stiffer high-density EoS to maximise the compactness. The Bayesian analysis demonstrates that the observational bounds are effective in significantly constraining the low-density region of the equation of state. It is also seen that the astrophysical bound prefers the phase transition in the intermediate-density range and also prefers a small density jump for a discontinuous equation of state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528NICER\u548cGW\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7ea6\u675f\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7269\u8d28\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790PSR J0614-3329\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u504f\u597d\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u7269\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u76f8\u53d8\u53d1\u751f\u8f83\u665a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u6700\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u89c2\u6d4b\uff08NICER\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6570\u636e\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7269\u8d28\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5229\u7528\u6700\u65b0\u7684PSR J0614-3329\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u6570\u636e\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7269\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e09\u7c7b\u57fa\u4e8e\u58f0\u901f\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u8bba\u7269\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7ea6\u675f\u7269\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5404\u63d2\u503c\u6bb5\u7684\u58f0\u901f\u5e73\u65b9\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u52bf\uff09\u3002", "result": "NICER\u548cGW\u7ea6\u675f\u90fd\u6307\u5411\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u7269\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u76f8\u53d8\u53d1\u751f\u8f83\u665a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u6700\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u6700\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6700\u5927\u81f4\u5bc6\u5e8f\u5217\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b\u89c2\u6d4b\u8fb9\u754c\u6709\u6548\u7ea6\u675f\u4e86\u7269\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\u504f\u597d\u4e2d\u7b49\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u5c0f\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8df3\u8dc3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7ea6\u675f\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7269\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u504f\u597d\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u7269\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u8f83\u665a\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7269\u8d28\u6027\u8d28\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

The bursts exhibit significant morphological diversity, including multiple sub-bursts, downward frequency drifts, and intrinsic widths ranging from 1.032 - 32.159 ms. Bursts were detected in both Band 4 (550 - 950 MHz) and Band 5 (1060 - 1460 MHz), with the last Band 5 burst occurring on 24 May, while Band 4 activity persisted until 28 May, indicating a frequency-dependent decline. Consecutive bursts were observed with separations of 16.7 - 291.5 ms, revealing short repetition intervals or potential sub-second quasi-periodicity. The waiting-time and energy distributions are bimodal, suggesting at least two distinct emission timescales and energy modes. Burst fluence ranges from 1.72 - 78.47 Jy ms, and the cumulative fluence distribution follows a broken power law. Multi-frequency analysis further shows closely spaced burst pairs across Band 4 and Band 5, with sub-second offsets of 1.08 - 1.15 s, and no strict simultaneity with contemporaneous FAST detections. These findings demonstrate that FRB 20201124A exhibits closely spaced, patchy, multi-frequency emission with frequency-dependent activity, highlighting the complex and dynamic nature of repeating FRBs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5347\u7ea7\u7684\u5de8\u578b\u7c73\u6ce2\u5c04\u7535\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u5bf9\u91cd\u590d\u5feb\u901f\u5c04\u7535\u66b4FRB 20201124A\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u65f6\u671f\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u7206\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u3001\u77ed\u91cd\u590d\u95f4\u9694\u548c\u53cc\u5cf0\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4/\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u590d\u5feb\u901f\u5c04\u7535\u66b4FRB 20201124A\u5728\u6d3b\u8dc3\u671f\u7684\u7206\u53d1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u91cd\u590dFRB\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5347\u7ea7\u7684\u5de8\u578b\u7c73\u6ce2\u5c04\u7535\u671b\u8fdc\u955c(uGMRT)\u57282021\u5e745\u67088\u65e5\u81f328\u65e5\u671f\u95f4\u5bf9FRB 20201124A\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u65f6\u671f\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u8986\u76d6Band 4(550-950 MHz)\u548cBand 5(1060-1460 MHz)\u4e24\u4e2a\u9891\u6bb5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7206\u53d1\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u591a\u9891\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7206\u53d1\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u591a\u6837\u6027(\u591a\u91cd\u5b50\u7206\u53d1\u3001\u5411\u4e0b\u9891\u7387\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u5bbd\u5ea61.032-32.159 ms)\uff1bBand 5\u6d3b\u52a8\u57285\u670824\u65e5\u505c\u6b62\u800cBand 4\u6301\u7eed\u52305\u670828\u65e5\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u8870\u51cf\uff1b\u8fde\u7eed\u7206\u53d1\u95f4\u969416.7-291.5 ms\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u77ed\u91cd\u590d\u95f4\u9694\u6216\u4e9a\u79d2\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\uff1b\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u5448\u53cc\u5cf0\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u81f3\u5c11\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u591a\u9891\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aBand 4\u548cBand 5\u4e2d\u7d27\u5bc6\u95f4\u9694\u7684\u7206\u53d1\u5bf9(\u504f\u79fb1.08-1.15 s)\uff0c\u4e0e\u540c\u65f6\u671fFAST\u63a2\u6d4b\u6ca1\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u540c\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FRB 20201124A\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7d27\u5bc6\u95f4\u9694\u3001\u6591\u5757\u72b6\u3001\u591a\u9891\u53d1\u5c04\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cd\u590d\u5feb\u901f\u5c04\u7535\u66b4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}
