Submitted to CQG", "summary": "Relativistic macroscopic plasma dynamics can be described by\ngeneral-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. In many high-energy astrophysical\nsettings, such as the interior dynamics of magnetized stars, the ideal GRMHD\napproximation, in which we assume infinite conductivity, provides an excellent\ndescription. However, ideal GRMHD neglects resistive effects that are essential\nfor processes such as magnetic reconnection, dissipation, and magnetospheric\ndynamics. Incorporating resistivity into astrophysical plasma models accounts\nfor the fact that plasmas in such environments are not perfect conductors. We\npresent a resistive version of the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X, which\nevolves the full resistive GRMHD equations using the Z4c formalism for\nEinstein's equations. We implement a second-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta\nscheme to handle stiff source terms, obtain the primitive quantities from the\nconserved quantities using a one-dimensional recovery method, and employ the\nHLLE Riemann solver in combination with TVD and WENO reconstruction schemes. We\nvalidate the module using a range of standard tests, including 1D shocktubes,\ncurrent sheets, Alfv\\'{e}n waves, 2D cylindrical explosions, and 3D TOV stars.\nThe results of these tests demonstrate accurate recovery of the ideal MHD\nlimit, correct resistive behavior, and stable evolution in dynamical\nspacetimes. Leveraging the GPU-accelerated resistive version of GRaM-X enables\nefficient large-scale simulations, paving the way for realistic studies of\nbinary mergers, accretion flows, and relativistic jets within the framework of\nmulti-messenger astrophysics."}

A\nsignificant calibration challenge for high-frequency VLBI stems from rapid\nvariations in the atmospheric water vapor content above each telescope in the\narray, which induce corresponding fluctuations in the phase of the correlated\nsignal that limit the coherent integration time and thus the achievable\nsensitivity. In this paper, we introduce a model that describes station-based\nphase corruptions jointly with a parameterization for the source structure. We\nadopt a Gaussian Process (GP) prescription for the time evolution of these\nphase corruptions, which provides sufficient flexibility to capture even highly\nerratic phase behavior. The use of GPs permits the application of a Kalman\nfiltering algorithm for numerical marginalization of these phase corruptions,\nwhich permits efficient exploration of the remaining parameter space.

Using simulations the study tracks how sudden\naccretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop)\nduring which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains\nnearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition\nbetween two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion,\nand how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that\nboosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest\neffect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the\nregion of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance. In\nparticular, a super-Eddington accretion rate of 5 times Eddington accretion,\nlasting for 4 Myr and occurring 30 Myr before the superradiance drop can reduce\nthe superradiance exclusion region in the mass-spin plane by 40 percent. In\ncontrast, boosts to the accretion rate after the superradiance drop only cause\ntemporary changes in the black hole spin. The study also shows that black holes\nwith lighter axion clouds are more sensitive to these early boosts and can show\nobservable spin changes lasting tens to hundreds of millions of years. Heavier\naxion clouds, however, require much stronger or longer-lasting boosts to\nproduce similar effects, making them more stable under variable accretion."}

With a physically motivated topological perspective,\nwe leverage the strengths of these methods and present results that span from\nprospective source classification and the emergence of new classes to catalog\ncomparison, among other applications. This new approach enables fresh\ninterpretations of longstanding problems, laying a new foundation for\nvisualizing the pulsar population and categorizing sources. Building on this,\nwe identify several sources as likely members of specific binary subclasses and\ninvestigate the potential transitional nature of others. Furthermore, we extend\nthe use of graph theory to the boundary of machine learning, demonstrating its\ncapability for binary separation in an unsupervised context. Finally, we\nintroduce and apply an innovative, flexible time-series alignment technique to\nthe field of gamma-ray astrophysics. The method identifies notable similarities\namong the light curves of gamma-ray pulsars. The results presented here are\npromising, offering a refreshing direction for the field and new pathways for\nrigorous mathematical analysis, ultimately providing meaningful alternatives to\ntraditional approaches in high-energy astrophysics."}

The former is thought to form a\ngeometrically thin disc while the diffuse wind could form a geometrically thick\nhot accretion flow. In this paper, we instead consider a more generalised case,\ni.e., accretion with both cold and hot gas supplies, which feed a disc and a\ncorona respectively. We investigate the interaction of disc and corona by\nanalysing the energy coupling and matter exchange, i.e. corona\ncondensation/disc evaporation, with a semi-analytical method. It is found that\nthe accretion geometry in the radial direction and the resultant emission\nspectrum depend strongly on both the total gas supply rate and the ratio of\ncold and hot gases. For gas supply rates of a few percent of the Eddington\nvalue, diverse geometries and spectral shapes are possible, depending on the\nfraction of cold gas supply. This provides an interpretation for the various\nspectra observed in intermediate states. However, at higher accretion rates,\nregardless of the form of the feeding gas, the inner accretion flow is always\ndisc-dominated, implying an inevitable transition to the soft state, while at\nvery low gas supply rates, hard state spectrum dominated by the hot flow is\nexpected. We also present the predicted hardness-intensity correlation of\nCygnus X-1, and constrain the value of the viscosity parameter of the accretion\nflow to the range of 0.25--0.35 by comparing our results with MAXI\nobservations."}

Since an\n$X_{\\rm max}$ dependence leads to a primary composition dependence, this\nimplies that information on the mass composition is encoded not only in the LDF\nshape but also in its amplitude. This $X_{\\rm max}$ dependence can be explained\nin terms of two competing scalings of the measured electric field: One goes\nwith $(1/\\rho)^J$, where $\\rho$ is the air density at $X_{\\rm max}$ and $J$ is\na zenith dependent non-linearity factor describing coherence loss. This density\nscaling tends to decrease the geomagnetic emission of deeper showers. The other\nscaling goes with $(1/R)$, where $R$ is the distance from $X_{\\rm max}$ to the\ncore at ground, and instead increases the measured electric field of deeper\nshowers. At low zenith angles, the $(1/R)$ scaling is stronger and leads to\nlarger measured electric fields as $X_{\\rm max}$ increases. The picture at\nhigher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the\ndeflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time\ndelays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission.\nThis loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic\nfield and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission\nwith decreasing air density. This strong, yet historically overlooked LDF\namplitude dependence on $X_{\\rm max}$/composition could be used to directly\ninfer, even bypassing any $X_{\\rm max}$ reconstruction, the cosmic ray primary\ncomposition on an event-by-event basis. It could also have some repercussions\non other radio reconstruction methods, such as a possible $X_{\\rm\nmax}$/composition bias on shower electromagnetic energy reconstruction methods."}

To do so, we systematically\nevaluate how these gaps alter observed variability patterns, mask genuine\nperiodic signals, and introduce false periodicity detections. This evaluation\nis conducted using both simulated and real observational data. We assess a\nrange of widely used time series analysis methods, including the Lomb-Scargle\nperiodogram, Phase Dispersion Minimization, and the recently proposed Singular\nSpectrum Analysis (SSA). Our results demonstrate a clear and significant\ndegradation in period detection reliability when the percentage of gaps exceeds\n50\\%. In such cases, the period-significance relationship becomes increasingly\ndistorted, often leading to misleading results. Among the tested methods, SSA\nstands out for its ability to yield consistent and robust detections despite\nhigh data incompleteness. Additionally, the analyzed methods tend to identify\nartificial periodicities of around one year, likely due to seasonal sampling\neffects, which can result in false positives if not carefully recognized.\nFinally, the periods detected with $\\geq$3$\\sigma$ confidence are unlikely to\nresult from stochastic processes or from the presence of gaps in the analyzed\ntime series."}

In this paper, we analyze the Fermi-LAT\nobservations of NGC 7469, which yield non-detection. By requiring the cascade\nflux accompanying neutrino production not to exceed the upper limit of the GeV\nflux, the size of the neutrino-emitting region can be constrained when the\nneutrino flux takes a high value of the allowed range. We suggest that protons\nare accelerated to PeV energies via turbulence or magnetic reconnection in the\ncorona of NGC 7469 and interact with OUV photons from the accretion disk and\nX-rays from the corona through the $p\\gamma$ process, producing neutrinos with\nenergy of 100-200 TeV.
