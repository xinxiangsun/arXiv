### [1] [Polarization based direction of arrival estimation using a radio interferometric array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15116)
*Sarod Yatawatta*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用射电干涉阵列子集进行低成本的波达方向估计方法，无需成像过程，适合瞬态和低占空比源检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DOA估计需要专门设计的阵列，而现有的射电干涉阵列由于几何结构任意和频率变化大，难以直接用于DOA估计，除非通过成像过程。

Method: 使用射电干涉阵列的子集，仅利用部分数据，在无需成像的情况下进行DOA估计，实现早期DOA确定。

Result: 该方法能够实现低成本的DOA估计，特别适合瞬态源和低占空比源的检测，并且是在线射频干扰抑制后的理想后续步骤。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为使用现有射电干涉阵列进行DOA估计提供了可行的替代方案，避免了复杂的成像过程，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is mostly performed using specialized
arrays that have carefully designed receiver spacing and layouts to match the
operating frequency range. In contrast, radio interferometric arrays are
designed to optimally sample the Fourier space data for making high quality
images of the sky.
  Therefore, using existing radio interferometric arrays (with arbitrary
geometry and wide frequency variation) for DOA estimation is practically
infeasible except by using images made by such interferometers. In this paper,
we focus on low cost DOA estimation without imaging, using a subset of a radio
interferometric array, using a fraction of the data collected by the full
array, and, enabling early determination of DOAs. The proposed method is
suitable for transient and low duty cycle source detection. Moreover, the
proposed method is an ideal follow-up step to online radio frequency
interference (RFI) mitigation, enabling the early estimation of the DOA of the
detected RFI.

### [2] [HyperAIRI: a plug-and-play algorithm for precise hyperspectral image reconstruction in radio interferometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15198)
*Chao Tang,Arwa Dabbech,Adrian Jackson,Yves Wiaux*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: HyperAIRI是AIRI的高光谱扩展版本，采用即插即用方法，通过学习的去噪器在高光谱射电干涉成像中实现高分辨率、高动态范围的图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代射电干涉望远镜需要能够处理大容量数据、宽频带的高分辨率高动态范围成像算法，现有单色成像方法AIRI表现优异，需要扩展到高光谱场景。

Method: 基于前向-后向算法结构，交替进行数据保真度步骤和正则化步骤。使用学习的高光谱去噪器，结合幂律谱模型，每个谱通道的去噪器输入当前图像估计、相邻通道估计和谱指数图，输出去噪图像。采用Jacobian正则化确保收敛，并构建预训练去噪器库以适应不同动态范围。

Result: 在模拟和真实观测数据上评估，HyperAIRI表现出优于基于优化的Hyper-uSARA、WSClean中的CLEAN高光谱变体以及单色成像算法AIRI和uSARA的性能。

Conclusion: HyperAIRI在高光谱射电干涉成像中实现了最先进的性能，通过学习的去噪器和谱模型约束，显著提升了图像重建质量。

Abstract: The next-generation radio-interferometric (RI) telescopes require imaging
algorithms capable of forming high-resolution high-dynamic-range images from
large data volumes spanning wide frequency bands. Recently, AIRI, a
plug-and-play (PnP) approach taking the forward-backward algorithmic structure
(FB), has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in monochromatic RI imaging
by alternating a data-fidelity step with a regularisation step via learned
denoisers. In this work, we introduce HyperAIRI, its hyperspectral extension,
underpinned by learned hyperspectral denoisers enforcing a power-law spectral
model. For each spectral channel, the HyperAIRI denoiser takes as input its
current image estimate, alongside estimates of its two immediate neighbouring
channels and the spectral index map, and provides as output its associated
denoised image. To ensure convergence of HyperAIRI, the denoisers are trained
with a Jacobian regularisation enforcing non-expansiveness. To accommodate
varying dynamic ranges, we assemble a shelf of pre-trained denoisers, each
tailored to a specific dynamic range. At each HyperAIRI iteration, the spectral
channels of the target image cube are updated in parallel using
dynamic-range-matched denoisers from the pre-trained shelf. The denoisers are
also endowed with a spatial image faceting functionality, enabling scalability
to varied image sizes. Additionally, we formally introduce Hyper-uSARA, a
variant of the optimisation-based algorithm HyperSARA, promoting joint sparsity
across spectral channels via the l2,1-norm, also adopting FB. We evaluate
HyperAIRI's performance on simulated and real observations. We showcase its
superior performance compared to its optimisation-based counterpart
Hyper-uSARA, CLEAN's hyperspectral variant in WSClean, and the monochromatic
imaging algorithms AIRI and uSARA.

### [3] [Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15315)
*Yicun Duan,Xinyue Li,Camille Avestruz,Jeffrey Regier*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 该论文探索使用神经后验估计(NPE)方法进行天文目录构建，相比传统方法在LSST模拟数据上表现更优，能提供校准良好的后验分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LSST观测站将产生海量天文图像数据，传统确定性目录构建方法缺乏统计一致性，现有概率方法存在计算效率低、准确性差或无法处理多波段合成图像等问题。

Method: 采用神经后验估计(NPE)这一贝叶斯推断方法，利用深度学习实现计算效率和准确性。在DC2模拟天空调查数据集上进行评估。

Result: NPE在光源检测、通量测量、恒星/星系分类和星系形状测量方面系统性地优于标准LSST流程，并提供校准良好的后验近似。

Conclusion: NPE在模拟数据中显示出巨大潜力，虽然在实际应用中存在模型错误设定的挑战，但有多种策略可以减轻其影响。

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will
commence full-scale operations in 2026, yielding an unprecedented volume of
astronomical images. Constructing an astronomical catalog, a table of imaged
stars, galaxies, and their properties, is a fundamental step in most scientific
workflows based on astronomical image data. Traditional deterministic
cataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed
problem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational
inefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband
coadded images, the primary output format for LSST images. In this article, we
explore a recently developed Bayesian inference method called neural posterior
estimation (NPE) as an approach to cataloging. NPE leverages deep learning to
achieve both computational efficiency and high accuracy. When evaluated on the
DC2 Simulated Sky Survey -- a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to
mimic LSST data -- NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in
light source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and
galaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior
approximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data,
illustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification.
Although some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application
of NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its
effects.

### [4] [BREAKFAST: A Framework for general joint BA duty and follow-up guidance of multiple $γ$-ray monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15816)

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 开发了BREAKFAST框架，用于统一处理GHS星座联合值班中的伽马射线暴触发信号，实现自动化处理、筛选高价值目标并指导后续观测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多任务伽马射线监测器联合值班带来的挑战，包括触发数量增加和系统间切换不便，满足多波段、多信使天文学的需求。

Method: 开发包含自动化、半自动化和手动管道的定制框架，集成全面分析模块，特别是基于瞬时辐射特性预测X射线余辉亮度的专用模块。

Result: 框架在近期观测活动中已证明有效性，能够快速处理不同仪器的触发信号并筛选高价值目标。

Conclusion: BREAKFAST框架有望在未来特殊瞬变源的发现和观测中发挥重要作用，成为瞬时辐射观测与余辉观测之间的重要桥梁。

Abstract: With the growing number of gamma-ray monitors in operation, several research
teams have adopted a strategy of joint operation and scientific duty to improve
efficiency. A successful example is the GECAM-HXMT-SVOM (GHS) constellation
collaboration, which sets a precedent for other gamma-ray monitor
constellations. However, joint duty also presents challenges to Burst Advocates
(BAs), including the increased number of triggers and, more importantly, the
frequent switching between various systems due to incompatibilities among
different missions, which complicates the situation. To address the current
requirements of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astronomy, we developed a
customized framework for unified trigger processing within the GHS joint duty,
named "BA's Rapid Evaluation and Analysis Kit for Formulating Alerts and
Summary Tools" (BREAKFAST). This framework incorporates a series of automated,
semi-automated, and manual pipelines designed to rapidly process triggers of
prompt emissions in the gamma-ray band from different instruments, while
maintaining flexible compatibility for future missions. The pursuit of
BREAKFAST goes beyond merely providing trigger processing for BAs. BREAKFAST
also aims to filtering high-value targets and guiding follow-up telescopes
through rapid analysis and reporting, thus serving as an important bridge
between prompt emission observations and afterglow observations. To this end, a
suite of comprehensive analysis modules is included in BREAKFAST, particularly
the specially designed module that predicts X-ray afterglow brightness based on
prompt emission properties. The framework's effectiveness has already been
demonstrated in recent observational campaigns, and it is expected to play a
significant role in the discovery and observation of peculiar transients in the
future.

### [5] [Impact of Neutrino Flavor Conversions on Neutron Star Merger Dynamics, Ejecta, Nucleosynthesis, and Multi-Messenger Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15028)
*Yi Qiu,David Radice,Sherwood Richers,Federico Maria Guercilena,Albino Perego,Maitraya Bhattacharyya*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 本文通过数值相对论模拟研究了双中子星合并中的中微子味转换效应，包括快味不稳定性、量子多体效应和超出标准模型的物理。味转换会显著增加中子丰度，提升r过程产额，并影响引力波和中微子辐射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中微子味转换在双中子星合并过程中的作用，特别是对物质成分、r过程核合成以及引力波和中微子信号的影响，以改进对合并事件的理论理解。

Method: 使用数值相对论模拟双中子星合并，纳入中微子味转换机制，包括快味不稳定性、量子多体效应和超出标准模型的物理，分析不同味转换时间尺度的影响。

Result: 味转换使物质条件更加中子丰富，产生高达300%更多的中子丰富喷射物，显著提升r过程产额，特别是在低密度近赤道流出中。快味不稳定性区域持续存在，慢味转换与热力学平衡相互作用进一步增加中子丰度。

Conclusion: 中微子味转换在双中子星合并中具有重要影响，能显著改变物质成分和核合成过程，并可能增强引力波和中微子辐射，需要进一步改进味不稳定性的理论模型。

Abstract: We present numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers
incorporating neutrino flavor transformations triggered by fast flavor
instability, quantum many-body effects, or potential beyond standard model
physics. In both long-lived and short-lived remnant scenarios, neutrino flavor
conversions modify species-dependent neutrino luminosities and mean energies,
and drive the matter towards more neutron rich conditions. They produce up to
$300\%$ more neutron rich ejecta and significantly boost the r-process yields,
especially in low-density, near-equatorial outflows. We identify regions
unstable to fast flavor instabilities and find that these instabilities persist
despite flavor conversions. We further test the sensitivity to the
equilibration timescale of the flavor conversions, finding that slower flavor
conversions can interact with thermodynamic equilibration, and increase the
neutron richness of the ejecta. Flavor conversions may also contribute to
stronger gravitational wave and neutrino emissions, pointing to a correlation
between neutrino transport and merger dynamics. These results highlight the
potential impact of flavor conversions while motivating future work to improve
on theoretical understanding of flavor instabilities in global simulations.

### [6] [Event types in H.E.S.S.: a combined analysis for different telescope types and energy ranges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15454)
*Rodrigo Guedes Lang,Tim Unbehaun,Lars Mohrmann,Simon Steinmassl,Jim Hinton,Stefan Funk*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型IACT分析方法，能够同时利用H.E.S.S.实验中不同类型望远镜和触发策略，实现全能量范围覆盖和灵敏度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决H.E.S.S.实验中28米和12米望远镜在单目和立体模式下难以协同工作的问题，实现更宽能量范围的覆盖。

Method: 基于Hillas参数定义三种事件类型（M型、B型、A型），每种类型在不同能量范围占主导，结合两种望远镜类型和触发策略。

Result: 新分析方法在整个能量范围内提供最优灵敏度，相比标准Mono和Stereo配置灵敏度提升25-45%，使用蟹状星云真实数据验证有效。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了不同类型望远镜的协同分析，扩大了能量覆盖范围，降低了能量阈值，提高了统计精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) are the main technique for
detecting gamma rays with energies between tens of GeV and hundreds of TeV.
Amongst them, the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) has pioneered the
use of different telescope types to achieve an energy range as broad as
possible. A large, 28 m diameter telescope is used in monoscopic mode to access
the lowest energies ($E \gtrsim 30$ GeV), while the four smaller, 12 m diameter
telescopes are used in stereoscopic mode to study energies between 150 GeV and
100 TeV. Nevertheless, a combination of both telescope types and trigger
strategies has proven to be challenging. In this work, we propose for the first
time an analysis based on event types capable of exploiting both telescope
types, trigger strategies, and the whole energy range of the experiment. Due to
the large differences between monoscopic and stereoscopic reconstructions, the
types are defined based on Hillas parameters of individual events, resulting in
three types (Type M, Type B, and Type A), each dominating over a different
energy range. The performances of the new analysis configurations are compared
to the standard configurations in the H.E.S.S. Analysis Package (HAP), Mono and
Stereo. The proposed analysis provides optimal sensitivity over the whole
energy range, in contrast to Mono and Stereo, which focus on smaller energy
ranges. On top of that, improvements in sensitivity of 25-45% are found for
most of the energy range. The analysis is validated using real data from the
Crab Nebula, showing the application to data of an IACT analysis capable of
combining significantly different telescope types with significantly different
energy ranges. Larger energy coverage, lower energy threshold, smaller
statistical uncertainty, and more robustness are observed. The need for a
run-by-run correction for the observation conditions is also highlighted.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Gradus.jl是一个用Julia编写的开源广义相对论光线追踪工具包，用于任意时空中的光谱建模。它利用前向自动微分计算Christoffel符号和传播导数，支持计算Cunningham传递函数和包含时间信息的传递函数形式，用于分析吸积盘反射模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个通用的广义相对论光线追踪工具包，用于光谱建模，特别是在任意时空中进行精确的数值计算和导数传播，以支持高效的相对论效应预计算和反射模型分析。

Method: 使用Julia编程语言，利用前向自动微分计算Christoffel符号和传播导数，实现Cunningham传递函数的优化计算，并扩展传递函数形式以包含时间信息，用于计算高分辨率回波滞后光谱。

Result: 成功验证了模型与其他代码的对比测试，计算了不同灯柱高度和爱丁顿比率下的Shakura-Sunyaev吸积盘的滞后频率和滞后能量光谱，并讨论了盘厚度在反射模型中的一般影响。

Conclusion: Gradus.jl提供了一个强大且可扩展的工具，用于广义相对论光线追踪和光谱建模，特别是在处理非零垂直高度盘的自遮挡和计算高分辨率回波滞后光谱方面表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce Gradus.jl, an open-source and publicly available general
relativistic ray-tracing toolkit for spectral modelling in arbitrary
spacetimes. Our software is written in the Julia programming language, making
use of forward-mode automatic differentiation for computing the Christoffel
symbols during geodesic integration, and for propagating derivatives through
the entire ray-tracer. Relevant numerical methods are detailed, and our models
are validated using a number of tests and comparisons to other codes. The
differentiability is used to optimally calculate Cunningham transfer functions
-- used to efficiently pre-compute relativistic effects in spectral models. A
method is described for calculating such transfer functions for disc with
non-zero vertical height, including the treatment of self-obscuration. An
extension of the transfer function formalism that includes timing information
is described, and used to calculate high-resolution reverberation lag spectra
for a lamppost corona. The lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra for a
Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disc with various lamppost heights and Eddington
ratios are calculated, and the general impact of disc thickness in reflection
models is discussed.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 对引力波事件S240422ed进行近红外跟踪观测，发现5个候选对应体，但都不符合千新星特征，其中4个为已知瞬变天体，1个红色快速衰减天体性质不明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: S240422ed最初被分类为黑洞-中子星合并事件，有超过99%的概率产生电磁波辐射，因此进行近红外跟踪观测以寻找千新星对应体。

Method: 使用Subaru望远镜/MOIRCS在事件发生后7.8小时开始观测，在Y和Ks波段观测206个邻近星系，深度分别达到21.4和21.1 AB星等。

Result: 识别出5个候选对应体，其中4个与超新星或矮新星爆发等已知瞬变天体一致，1个红色快速衰减天体性质不明。所有候选体都不符合AT2017gfo等千新星特征。

Conclusion: 尽管后续分析重新将S240422ed分类为地面噪声，但这次近红外观测为未来引力波源观测提供了宝贵经验，证明深空近红外观测能有效约束200 Mpc距离内红色千新星的存在。

Abstract: We report our near-infrared (NIR) follow-up observations of the gravitational
wave (GW) event S240422ed using the Subaru Telescope/MOIRCS. S240422ed was
initially classified as a black hole-neutron star merger with $>$ 99%
probability of electromagnetic wave emission. We started follow-up observations
7.8 hours after the event. Over two nights, we observed 206 nearby galaxies in
$Y$ and $K_{\rm s}$ bands down to about 21.4 and 21.1 AB mag (3$\sigma$),
respectively. The total completeness of our survey based on galaxy $B$-band
luminosity is 22%. As a result of our observations, five candidate counterparts
were identified. We show that properties of these five objects are not
consistent with kilonova such as AT2017gfo. Four objects are consistent with
known classes of transients such as supernovae or dwarf nova outbursts. On the
other hand, the nature of the remaining one object, which shows a red color and
rapid decline, remains unclear. Although later analyses of GW signal
reclassified S240422ed as likely terrestrial noise, our NIR observations
provide valuable lessons for future NIR surveys for GW sources. We demonstrate
that deep NIR follow-up observations as presented in this work would
effectively constrain the presence of red kilonova even at 200 Mpc distance. We
also discuss the importance of deep and wide NIR reference images and of
understanding the properties and frequency of Galactic transients.

*Samuel G. D. Turner,Roman R. Rafikov,Alexander A. Philippov*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该研究通过数值模拟探讨了中心吸积体内部结构（多向性指数n）对边界层中声波激发和传播的影响，发现质量吸积率和角动量通量随n减小而降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究通常将中心天体内部结构建模为全局等温球体，具有急剧上升的密度分布。本研究旨在探索其他内部密度和温度分布对声波模式运行的影响。

Method: 使用二维流体动力学模拟，将吸积体内部分布建模为多向性球体，允许密度较浅增加和非平凡的温度分布。模拟持续时间为1000个内轨道周期。

Result: 声波模式的混合对多向性指数n的依赖性较弱，但质量吸积率和角动量通量随n降低而明显减小。在二维模拟中，这些输运指标与中心物体内总质量的相关性更好。

Conclusion: 研究量化了吸积体内部结构对边界层中声波激发和传播的影响，增进了对声波介导边界层吸积过程的理解。

Abstract: Disc accretion onto astrophysical objects with a material surface proceeds
through the boundary layer (BL) -- a radially narrow region in the inner disc
where the incoming gas must slow down its rotation before settling onto the
surface of the accretor. Here we numerically study a BL in which the angular
momentum transport in the layer is accomplished via the excitation of global
acoustic waves. While the earlier studies of such wave-mediated BLs typically
modeled the internal structure of the central object as a globally isothermal
sphere with sharply rising density profile, here we explore the effect of other
internal density and temperature profiles on the mode operation. We model the
inner structure of an accretor as a polytropic sphere, allowing a shallower
increase of density and a non-trivial temperature profile inside the object.
While the mix of acoustic modes observed in our long-duration (1000 inner
orbits long) 2D hydrodynamic simulations is a weak function of the polytropic
index $n$ of the accretor's structure, the mass accretion rate and the angular
momentum flux across the BL show a clear dependence on $n$, both decreasing in
amplitude as $n$ is lowered. Interestingly, in 2D these transport metrics are
better correlated not with $n$ but with a total mass inside the central object
contained within the simulation domain. These results improve our understanding
of the wave-mediated BL accretion by quantifying the effect of the inner
structure of the accretor on the excitation and propagation of acoustic modes
mediating the BL transport.

TL;DR: 使用支持向量机分析旋转超新星的引力波反弹信号，以推断高密度物质的物态方程，评估不同探测器对银河系及更远距离事件的探测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核心坍缩超新星的引力波为研究高密度物质物态方程提供了独特探针，特别是通过反弹信号来探索物态方程的推断潜力。

Method: 采用支持向量机对18种物态方程模型模拟的引力波信号进行分类，该方法在先前测试中表现最佳。

Result: 先进LIGO A+探测器可探测银河系事件的物态方程，而第三代观测站如爱因斯坦望远镜和宇宙探索者能探测更远距离。对于随机方向源，只有下一代探测器具备足够灵敏度。

Conclusion: 这些结果代表了探测核物态方程的潜在观测范围，但由于采用的简化假设，应视为近似上限。

Abstract: Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae provide a unique probe of
the equation of state (EOS) of high density matter. In this work, we focus on
the bounce signal from numerical simulations of rotating supernovae and explore
its potential for EOS inference. We employ a support vector machine, previously
shown to perform best among tested methods, to classify GW signals simulated
for 18 EOS models. For optimally oriented sources, we estimate that the
Advanced LIGO A+ detector can probe the EOS for Galactic events, while
third-generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic
Explorer can reach substantially farther. For randomly oriented sources, only
these next-generation detectors are expected to have sufficient sensitivity.
These results represent the potential observational range for probing the
nuclear EOS, although, due to the simplifying assumptions adopted, they should
be regarded as approximate upper limits.

### [11] [Universal Relations for Elastic Hybrid Stars and Quark Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15149)
*Chun-Ming Yip,Shu Yan Lau,Kent Yagi*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 本文研究了含有晶体色超导夸克物质的弹性混合星和夸克星是否遵循与流体星相同的I-λ₂-Q普适关系，发现这些关系在考虑现实夸克物质剪切模量时仍保持有效，但偏差比典型流体星稍大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一些致密星可能包含解禁闭夸克物质，形成混合星或夸克星。如果夸克物质处于晶体色超导相，其刚性可能显著改变恒星性质。本文旨在验证这些弹性星是否遵循流体星中已确立的普适关系。

Method: 通过允许静态球对称背景配置中的夸克物质发生剪切，将背景剪切处理为有效压力各向异性形式。然后计算具有压力各向异性的模型的转动惯量I、潮汐形变度λ₂和自旋诱导四极矩Q。

Result: 弹性混合星和夸克星的I-λ₂-Q普适关系在考虑晶体色超导相中最大夸克物质剪切模量时，有效性偏差约为2-3%，比典型流体星模型稍大。但与恒星致密性相关的普适关系不确定性仍与典型流体星模型相当。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，对于含有晶体色超导夸克物质导致的现实程度压力各向异性的混合星和夸克星，普适关系仍然有效。

Abstract: Some compact stars may contain deconfined quark matter, forming hybrid stars
or quark stars. If the quark matter forms an inhomogeneous condensate in the
crystalline color superconducting phase, its rigidity may be high enough to
noticeably alter the stellar properties. In this paper, we investigate whether
these elastic stars follow the universal relations, i.e., relations insensitive
to equations of state, that have been well established for fluid stars. We
improve upon previous studies by allowing quark matter in the background,
static, and spherically symmetric configuration to be sheared. Such background
shear can be treated in the form of an effective pressure anisotropy. We then
calculate the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability ${\lambda}_2$, and
spin-induced quadrupole moment $Q$ of these models with pressure anisotropy.
The $I$-${\lambda}_2$-$Q$ universal relations for the elastic hybrid (quark)
star models are valid up to a variation of $\approx2\,(3)\%$, larger than that
for typical fluid star models, when the maximal magnitude of quark matter shear
modulus is considered in the crystalline color superconducting phase from
realistic calculations. The uncertainty in universal relations related to the
stellar compactness for these elastic star models, on the other hand, remain
comparable to those for typical fluid star models. Our results demonstrate the
validity of universal relations for hybrid stars and quark stars with a
realistic degree of pressure anisotropy due to the crystalline color
superconducting quark matter.

under the guiding center approximation, which we term the MHD-gPIC method, and
it is implemented in the Athena++ MHD code. The new MHD-gPIC model consists of

evaluated source terms as particle backreaction. The code is validated with a
series of tests, and it is expected to be primarily applicable to study
particle acceleration and transport in systems where gyro-resonance is
considered insignificant. We also present preliminary studies of particle
acceleration during non-relativistic magnetic reconnection.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了I型X射线暴模型对带电粒子诱导反应速率不确定性的敏感性，识别出41个影响爆发光变曲线的关键反应和187个影响最终丰度的反应，为核反应实验提供了关键目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: I型X射线暴是吸积中子星表面的热核失控过程，受质子俘获和α俘获过程驱动。相应反应速率的不确定性是模拟爆发光变曲线和灰烬的主要限制因素。

Method: 研究分两个阶段：首先使用半解析框架结合完整反应网络确定点火条件，然后使用ONEZONE模型进行个体速率变化的敏感性分析。

Result: 识别出41个改变爆发光变曲线的反应和187个显著影响最终丰度的反应。瓶颈同位素上的反应对两个观测值都有强烈影响，而大多数(p,γ)反应仅影响最终成分。

Conclusion: 研究结果确定了减少X射线暴模型中核物理不确定性的关键核反应实验目标，特别是那些影响氦富集爆发中最终12C产额的反应，这对碳超爆发点火机制具有重要意义。

Abstract: Type I X-ray bursts (XRBs) are thermonuclear runaways on the surface of
accreting neutron stars, powered by rapid proton-capture and alpha-capture
processes on neutron-deficient nuclei. Uncertainties in the corresponding
reaction rates remain a major limitation in modeling burst light curves and
ashes. We present a systematic study of the sensitivity of XRB models to
uncertainties in charged-particle-induced reaction rates across a broad
parameter space of accretion rates and fuel compositions in low-mass X-ray
binaries. The study proceeds in two stages: ignition conditions are first
determined with a semi-analytic framework coupled to a full reaction network,
followed by a sensitivity analysis using the ONEZONE model with individual rate
variations. We identify 41 reactions that alter the burst light curve and 187
that significantly impact final abundances. Reactions on bottleneck isotopes in
the alpha-p- and rp-process paths strongly affect both observables, while most
(p, gamma) reactions on medium-mass (A > 32) and heavy-mass (A > 55) nuclei
influence only the final composition. Medium-mass cases dominate in He-rich
bursts, where the reaction flow terminates earlier, while heavy-mass cases
appear in mixed H and He bursts with extended rp-process paths reaching A ~
110. We identify a subset of reactions whose rate uncertainties exert influence
on the final 12C yield in helium-rich bursts, which could have important
consequences for the mechanism of ignition of carbon superbursts. Our results
identify key targets for nuclear reaction experiments to reduce nuclear physics
uncertainties in XRB models.

TL;DR: 本文讨论了引力波透镜化的检测方法，统一了频率主义和贝叶斯方法，推导了强透镜化的后验概率，并分析了选择效应的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA合作开始搜索引力波透镜化信号，需要解决检测重复引力波事件时面临的误报问题，特别是类似于"生日问题"的统计挑战。

Method: 使用贝叶斯方法统一不同的检测方法，推导强透镜化的后验概率，分析贝叶斯因子、先验概率和后验概率之间的关系，并考虑选择效应的影响。

Result: 发现后验概率对引力波事件数量不敏感，只要考虑了强透镜化时间延迟；选择效应在贝叶斯因子中作为归一化常数出现，但在后验概率中相互抵消。

Conclusion: 后验概率是检测引力波强透镜化的稳健统计量，不受选择效应影响，为引力波透镜化搜索提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Like light, gravitational waves are gravitationally lensed by intervening
massive astrophysical objects, such as galaxies, clusters, black holes, and
stars, resulting in a variety of potentially observable gravitational-wave
lensing signatures. Searches for gravitational-wave lensing by the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration have begun. One common method focuses on
strong gravitational-wave lensing, which produces multiple "images": repeated
copies of the same gravitational wave that differ only in amplitude, arrival
time, and overall "Morse phase." The literature identifies two separate
approaches to identifying such repeated gravitational-wave events based on
frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Several works have discussed selection
effects and identified challenges similar to the well-known "birthday problem",
namely, the rapidly increasing likelihood of false alarms in an ever-growing
catalogue of event pairs. Here, we discuss these problems, unify the different
approaches in Bayesian language, and derive the posterior odds for strong
lensing. In particular, the Bayes factor and prior odds are sensitive to the
number of gravitational-wave events in the data, but the posterior odds are
insensitive to it once strong lensing time delays are accounted for. We confirm
Lo et al.'s (2020) finding that selection effects enter the Bayes factor as an
overall normalisation constant. However, this factor cancels out in the
posterior odds and does not affect frequentist approaches to strong lensing
detection.

### [15] [Disentangling two spectral components in the X-ray emission of the blazar 1ES 0229+200](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15465)
*Alicja Wierzcholska,Hubert Siejkowski*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 对1ES 0229+200 blazar的长期X射线和光学观测分析，发现2021年NuSTAR观测到25 keV处的光谱上转折，可能与同步辐射和逆康普顿分量的过渡或光强子过程有关，支持该源可能是高能中微子发射源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过X射线观测更深入地理解blazar的宽带发射机制，特别是对1ES 0229+200这种具有极硬VHE γ射线光谱的高频峰值BL Lac天体的研究。

Method: 使用Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory从2008到2024年的X射线和光学观测数据，结合NuSTAR的硬X射线观测，进行长期光谱和时间分析。

Result: 在2021年8月的低X射线状态下，NuSTAR观测到25 keV处的凹形光谱上转折，这与之前没有该特征的观测形成对比。X射线发射可能超过100 keV而无显著截止。

Conclusion: 新发现的光谱上转折可能指示同步辐射和逆康普顿分量之间的过渡，或与涉及高能中微子的光强子过程相关，支持1ES 0229+200可能是高能中微子发射源的假设。

Abstract: X-ray observations are essential to achieve a deeper understanding of the
broadband emission mechanism in blazars. Here, we present a long-term spectral
and temporal analysis of X-ray and optical observations of 1E 0229+200
collected with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory from 2008 to 2024,
complemented by hard X-ray observations from the Nuclear Spectroscopic
Telescope Array NuSTAR. The blazar 1ES 0229+200 is a high-frequency, peaked BL
Lac object, known for its exceptionally hard very high-energy (VHE)
$\gamma$-ray spectrum extending up to 10 TeV. In August 2021, NuSTAR observed
the source in a low X-ray state, revealing a concave spectral shape with a
distinct upturn around 25 keV. This feature contrasts with previous
observations performed with NuSTAR and Swift-BAT, which showed no such spectral
upturn. Previous observations of 1ES 0229+200 and broadband SED (spectral
energy distribution) modelling suggest that its X-ray emission extends beyond
100 keV without a significant cutoff. The newly detected spectral upturn may
indicate a transition between the synchrotron and inverse Compton components or
could be linked to photohadronic processes involving high-energy neutrinos. We
discuss the implications of this finding in the context of blazar spectral
energy distributions, particularly the potential existence of a third SED bump
in the kiloelectronvolt to megaelectronvolt range. The observed spectral
features support the hypothesis that 1ES 0229+200 could be a source of
high-energy neutrino emission.

TL;DR: 通过宇宙学MHD模拟研究局部宇宙中星系团和宇宙网的扩散γ射线发射，发现当前Fermi-LAT观测灵敏度不足以探测这种由宇宙射线质子产生的辐射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探测宇宙射线质子与星系团和宇宙网中气体相互作用产生的扩散γ射线发射，可以为研究星系际磁场和暗物质相互作用模型提供重要约束。

Method: 使用首个带有实时光谱宇宙射线模型的宇宙学MHD模拟，模拟宇宙射线在激波处的注入、绝热能量变化和输运过程，直接从模拟的宇宙射线能量密度和光谱计算γ射线发射率。

Result: 在星系团和宇宙网丝状结构中所有结构形成和吸积激波处都发现了宇宙射线质子加速，但这些质子产生的扩散γ射线发射强度比Fermi-LAT当前上限低几个数量级。

Conclusion: 根据模型假设，需要灵敏度达到Fγ < 10^-11 γ s^-1 cm^-2才能探测到Coma星系团中的扩散发射，当前观测技术尚未达到这一水平。

Abstract: Context: Diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission from cosmic ray (CR) protons
scattering off the gas in the intracluster and intergalactic medium (ICM and
IGM) remains out of reach for current observations. Detecting this emission
would provide constraints on intergalactic magnetic fields as well as dark
matter interaction models. Aims: We aim to provide estimates for diffuse
$\gamma$-ray emission in the Fermi-LAT band from galaxy clusters and the cosmic
web in the local Universe. Methods: In this work we show results from the first
cosmological MHD simulation with an on-the-fly spectral CR model. We model CR
injection at shocks, account for adiabatic energy changes and advection of CR
protons, and obtain their $\gamma$-ray emissivity directly from the simulated
CR energy density and spectra. For this we use constrained initial conditions,
which evolve in a field closely resembling that of the local Universe, allowing
direct comparison to Fermi-LAT data on massive clusters. Results: We find CR
proton acceleration at all structure formation and accretion shocks in galaxy
clusters and cosmic web filaments. These protons provide the basis for diffuse
$\gamma$-ray emission in these regimes. The absolute value of the diffuse
$\gamma$-ray emission in our simulation lies a few orders of magnitude below
the current upper limits found by Fermi-LAT. Under the assumption of our model,
a sensitivity of $F_\gamma < 10^{-11} \: \gamma~ \text{s}^{-1}~\text{cm}^{-2}$
is required for a detection of diffuse emission in Coma.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释毫秒脉冲星（最古老但最快的脉冲星）的形成机制，验证脉冲星通过从伴星吸积物质而被加速的回收假说。

Method: 使用SEVN代码处理双星过程，开发自研代码模拟脉冲星演化（包括磁层演化、磁场衰减、引力制动和空间演化），采用极冠几何和条纹风模型分别模拟射电和γ射线发射。

Result: 成功重现观测到的射电和γ射线脉冲星群体，预测第四费米LAT目录中未识别脉冲星少于330个，发现大视角对观测回收脉冲星很重要，只有约7.5×10⁻³%的氧氖白矮星通过吸积诱导坍缩形成轻度回收脉冲星。

Conclusion: 回收假说得到验证，模拟结果与观测数据吻合良好，为未来脉冲星调查提供了重要预测和统计信息。

Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are the oldest but fastest pulsars known to date.
To explain how these pulsars could be formed, a new hypothesis was formulated:
the recycling of pulsars, i.e the fact that a pulsar could accrete matter from
a companion and been spun up. In this paper, we developed a population
synthesis algorithm for pulsars which belong to a binary, in order to check
whether most of the observed recycled pulsars were formed via an accretion
mechanism and derive statistics about their properties, that are difficult to
obtain through observations. We also make predictions for future surveys.
Toward the presented objectives, we use the code Stellar EVolution for N-body
(SEVN) to take into account all the binary processes and our own code to evolve
each pulsar self-consistently by taking into account the secular evolution of a
force-free magnetosphere, the magnetic field decay, gravitational braking and
spatial evolution. Each pulsar is born in binary with a main sequence
companion, and evolve to present time. The radio and $\gamma$-ray emission
locations were modeled by the polar cap geometry and striped wind model,
respectively. Our simulations seem to reproduce well the population of radio
and $\gamma$-ray pulsars observed in the selected surveys. We also found that
there should be less than $330$ unidentified pulsars in the Fourth Fermi-LAT
catalogue of $\gamma$-ray sources (4FGL). High values of the viewing angle
$\zeta$ seem to be needed to be able to observe the recycled pulsars, and it
also seems difficult to observe recycled pulsars with an aligned rotation axis
and magnetic axis (i.e., $\chi \leq 10${\deg}). We find that only a small
fraction, approximately $\sim 7.5\times10^{-3}$ %, of oxygen-neon white dwarfs
(ONeWDs) in binary systems appear to contribute to the population of mildly
recycled pulsars through accretion-induced collapse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 引力波警报后续观测中电磁候选体的稳健关联具有挑战性，因为存在大天区、宽距离不确定性以及每个事件中数十到数百个不相关光学瞬变源。

Method: 贝叶斯排序框架结合三维引力波天图、宿主星系信息、形态感知的宿主关联、经验偏移先验和本动速度修正。

Result: 在GW170817事件中，该方法将AT2017gfo排名为最佳候选体，并正确选择了NGC 4993作为宿主星系。

Conclusion: 该方法可直接应用于仅具有位置信息的瞬变候选体，能实现更有效的后续观测和更可靠的对应体识别。

Abstract: The robust association of electromagnetic candidates discovered during
follow-up of gravitational-wave alerts is challenging, not only due to the
large sky areas and broad distance uncertainties, but also due to the tens to
hundreds of unrelated optical transients that are observed per event. We
present a Bayesian ranking method to identify electromagnetic counterparts to
GW events using only location information. The framework combines
three-dimensional gravitational wave skymaps with host-galaxy information, a
morphology-aware host association, empirical offset priors, and peculiar
velocity corrections. We apply the method to GW170817 where it ranks AT2017gfo
as the top candidate and correctly selects NGC\,4993 as the host. The approach
is directly applicable to transient candidates with only location information
and enables more efficient follow-up with prioritized candidates and leads to
more reliable counterpart identification in current and future observing runs.

TL;DR: GRB 230906A是一个短时伽马暴，精确定位后发现与一个微弱星系G*重合，该星系位于z~0.453的星系群中，处于潮汐尾上，表明星系合并可能触发了前身星形成。

Motivation: 研究短时伽马暴GRB 230906A的宿主星系性质及其与星系群环境的关联，探索伽马暴前身星形成的可能机制。

Method: 使用哈勃空间望远镜进行深度成像，结合VLT/MUSE光谱观测确认星系群红移，分析X射线定位精度和偶然对齐概率。

Result: 发现GRB与微弱星系G*重合，该星系位于z~0.453的相互作用星系群中，处于延伸约180 kpc的潮汐尾上，偶然对齐概率小于4%。

Conclusion: GRB 230906A及其宿主星系位于星系群内，星系合并可能通过增强的恒星形成触发了前身致密双星的形成，最终导致中子星合并产生伽马暴并将r过程物质注入周围介质。

Abstract: We report the precise X-ray localization of GRB~230906A, a short duration
($T_{90}\sim$0.9 s) burst with no optical or radio counterpart. Deep imaging
with the Hubble Space Telescope detects a faint galaxy (G$^\ast$;
$F160W\simeq26$ AB mag) coincident with the sub-arcsecond X-ray position.
Compared with standard GRB galaxies, its faintness, compact size and color
would suggest a high redshift ($z\gtrsim$3) host. However, our observations
also reveal the presence of a galaxy group at $z\!\sim$0.453, confirmed
spectroscopically with VLT/MUSE, with clear signs of interactions and mergers
among group members. The GRB and its putative host project onto an extended
($\approx$180 kpc) tidal tail emerging from the group's central galaxy. The
probability of a chance alignment is small ($P_{cc}\!\lesssim\!4$\%), we thus
argue that the GRB and its galaxy G$^*$ reside within the group. Their peculiar
location along the tidal debris suggests that an enhanced burst of star
formation, induced by the galaxy merger, might have formed the progenitor
compact binary $\lesssim$700 Myr ago. The compact binary later evolved in a
neutron star merger which produced GRB 230906A and injected $r$-process
material into the surrounding circumgalactic medium.
