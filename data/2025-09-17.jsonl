A critical\nissue with previous magnetized neutron star studies is the treatment of\nmagnetic field anisotropy in the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. To\naddress this fundamental problem, we employ the chaotic magnetic field\napproximation, which allows for a self-consistent treatment of magnetic\npressure while maintaining isotropy. Using a relativistic mean field approach\nwith properly implemented magnetic field corrections, we compute mass-radius\nrelations and tidal deformability parameters for neutron stars with magnetic\nfield strengths ranging from $10^{15}$ to $10^{16}$ G. Our systematic study\nreveals that magnetic fields induce increases in both stellar radii\n(0.8--2.3\\%) and tidal deformabilities (4.2--18.1\\%) compared to field-free\ncases, with effects scaling approximately as $B^{1/2}$. These modifications,\nwhile modest, are potentially detectable with current and next-generation\ngravitational wave detectors. For a canonical $1.4\\,M_\\odot$ neutron star, the\ntidal deformability increases from $\\Lambda_{1.4} = 678 \\times 10^6$ in the\nabsence of magnetic fields to $\\Lambda_{1.4} = 803 \\times 10^6$ for $B =\n10^{16}$ G. We demonstrate that magnetic field effects must be considered when\nconstraining the neutron star equation of state using gravitational wave\nobservations, particularly for populations including highly magnetized neutron\nstars. Our results suggest that the current GW170817 constraint on tidal\ndeformability may require systematic corrections when accounting for magnetic\nfield effects. We provide scaling relations for magnetic field corrections and\ndiscuss the implications for population studies of neutron star mergers with\nnext-generation detectors."}

This\nunique setup allows for simultaneous measurements of low-energy ($\\sim\n\\rm{GeV}$) and high-energy ($\\gtrsim 400\\,\\rm{GeV}$) muons generated in\ncosmic-ray air showers. The correlation between these low- and high-energy\nmuons can serve as a valuable tool not only for analyzing cosmic-ray\ncomposition but also for tests of hadronic interaction models.

Previous calibration methods do not explicitly use the time\ninformation available and make assumptions on the impedance matching of the\nreference sources. Here we present a new calibration method based on noise wave\nparameters which fits a calibration solution over time and frequency to the\ndata, interpolating the solutions to the times at which the antenna is being\nmeasured. To test this method we simulate a dataset using measurements of the\nREACH receiver, modelling a low noise amplifier which is drifting over time.\nFitting a polynomial surface in frequency and time to the simulated data\ndemonstrates that we can remove the drift in the calibrated solution over time\nbut leaves a chromatic residual. We further show that we can remove assumptions\non the reflection coefficients of the reference noise source and the cold load,\nreducing degeneracies in the parameter fits. Applying this new calibration\nequation and surface fitting method to the simulated data removes the chromatic\nresidual in the calibrated spectrum and recovers the parameters to within 0.06%\nof the truth and a 97% reduction in the RMSE of the spectrum of the validation\nsource compared with previous calibration methods. For two parameters we report\nup to six times smaller fit error after the degeneracies are removed from the\ntime-based calibration."}

We develop numerical models to simulate this effect\nfor two distinct astrophysical scenarios: an emission-line circumstellar disk\nand an absorption-line binary system. Our simulations reveal a clear\nsensitivity of this temporal asymmetry to the system's inclination angle,\nvelocity symmetry, and internal dynamics.

This interaction gives rise to secondary radiation in\ndifferent wavelength ranges, known as reprocessed emission. In eclipsing LMXBs,\nthe reprocessed emission from the bursts can be examined during eclipses, as\nthe primary emission is blocked and only the reprocessed emission is visible.\nWe searched for bursts during eclipses in the archival RXTE data of the\neclipsing LMXBs and found them in EXO 0748-676 and XTE J1710-281. In EXO\n0748-676, seven bursts were found to occur near eclipse egress, with their\ntails extending beyond the eclipse, and one such burst was found for XTE\nJ1710-281. We estimate the reprocessing fraction at orbital phases near eclipse\negress by modeling the peculiar eclipse bursts detected in both systems, which\nhave tails extending beyond the eclipses. We observe an increasing trend in\nreprocessing fraction as these eclipse bursts occur closer to the eclipse\negress. We discuss the possibilities of reprocessing in the ablated wind from\nthe companion star, the accretion disc, and the disc wind in EXO 0748-676 and\nXTE J1710-281. Additionally, we observe two decay components in the bursts in\nEXO 0748-676, which could suggest a complex composition of the accreting fuel.\nFrom the burst rise timescales, we place an upper limit on the size of the\nreprocessing regions in both EXO 0748-676 and XTE J1710-281, finding it\ncomparable to the size of the respective X-ray binaries."}

The\ndata consists in 14 tracking passes of the BepiColombo spacecraft collected\nbetween October 2023 and March 2024 during two separate test campaigns. We\nanalyzed the performance of the beam-crossing technique and compared it with\nthe nominal radiometer pointing through the analysis of the Doppler residuals\nextracted from the orbit determination process. Results show that the\nbeam-crossing performed similarly to the standard pointing, with modest noise\nreductions and improved stability only at time scales between 100 s and 300 s.\nKey factors affecting the results include the antenna elevation and the\nboundary layer height, indicating the need to revisit initial test assumptions,\nwhich comprised a fixed boundary layer. Furthermore, comparing the\nbeam-crossing test results with those obtained during the first two BepiColombo\nsuperior solar conjunction experiments highlights a potential application of\nthis technique during periods of solar conjunction. However, technical\nchallenges, adverse weather, and limited Ka-band transponder use, reduced the\nnumber of analyzed tracking passes.
