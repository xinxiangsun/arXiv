Searching for artifacts in the solar system has received relatively\nlittle formal scientific interest and has faced significant technical and\nsocial challenges. Automated surveys and new observational techniques developed\nover the past decade now enable astronomers to survey parts of the sky for\nanomalous objects.\n  We briefly describe four methods for detecting extraterrestrial artifacts and\nprobes within the Solar System and then focus on demonstrating one of these.\nThe first makes use of pre-Sputnik images to search for flashes from glinting\nobjects. The second method makes use of space-borne telescopes to search for\nartificial objects. A third approach involves examining the reflectance spectra\nof objects in Earth orbit, in search of the characteristic reddening that may\nimply long-term exposure of metallic surfaces to space weathering. We focus\nhere on a fourth approach, which involves using Earth's shadow as a filter when\nsearching for optically luminous objects in near-Earth space. We demonstrate a\nproof-of-concept of this method by conducting two searches for transients in\nimages acquired by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which has generated\nmany repeated 30-second exposures of the same fields.\n  In this way, we identified previously uncatalogued events at short angular\nseparations from the center of the shadow, motivating more extensive searches\nusing this technique. We conclude that the Earth's shadow presents a new and\nexciting search domain for near-Earth SETI."}

We aim to study the diffuse X-ray emission around PSR\nJ1740+1000 and its tail to investigate the origin of 1LHAASO J1740+0948u\nthrough a multi-wavelength SED fitting, testing different scenarios. We\nanalysed ~500 ks of XMM-Newton observations and studied for the first time the\ndiffuse emission around the pulsar.

We then performed a fit of the SED,\nincluding the spectrum of 1LHAASO J1740+0948u and the X-ray data obtained from\neither the analysis of the tail or the diffuse emission, to understand whether\none of the two X-ray sources could be related to the TeV emission and attempt a\nsource classification.

The two\ndominant interpretations favor hot exozodiacal dust or a faint companion, as\nboth can produce similar signatures. Method: We modeled a system consisting of\na star and a faint companion within a field of view of 2au x 2au. We calculated\nthe visibility and closure phases for three VLTI instruments (PIONIER, GRAVITY,\nand MATISSE) and four telescope configurations. Aim: We aim to investigate the\ninterferometric signatures of faint companions and assess their detectability.\nWe explore limitations of current detection methods and evaluate the challenges\nin distinguishing between hot exozodiacal dust and a faint companion as the\nsource of the observed excess. Results: We derived an upper limit for the\ncompanion-induced visibility deficit and closure phase. Contrary to the common\ninterpretation that near-zero closure phases rule out the presence of a\ncompanion, we show that companions can remain undetected in closure phase data,\nas indicated by significant non-detection probabilities, yet, these companions\ncan still produce measurable visibility deficits. We confirmed our results by\nreevaluating an L-band observation of kappa Tuc A. We found indications for a\nfaint companion with a flux ratio of 0.7% and an estimated non-detection\nprobability of around 21%, which could explain the variability of the\npreviously observed visibility deficit. Conclusions: Previous companion\nrejection criteria, such as near-zero closure phases and flux estimates based\non Gaussian-distributed dust densities, are not universally valid. This\nhighlights the need for a reevaluation of companion rejections in former\nstudies of the hot exozodiacal dust phenomenon.

The gradients associated with these inhomogeneous\nplasma regions serve as free energy sources that can drive plasma\ninstabilities, including the lower-hybrid drift instability (LHDI). Notably,\nlower-hybrid waves are frequently observed in magnetized space plasma\nenvironments, such as Earth's magnetotail and magnetopause. Previous studies\nhave primarily focused on modeling particle acceleration via LHDI in these\nregions using a quasilinear approach. This study expands the investigation of\nLHDI to a broader range of environments, spanning weakly to strongly magnetized\nmedia, including interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic, and intracluster\nplasmas. To explore the applicability of LHDI in various astrophysical\nsettings, we employ two key parameters: (1) plasma magnetization, characterized\nby the plasma beta parameter, and (2) the spectral slope of suprathermal\nelectrons following a power-law distribution. Using a quasilinear model, we\ndetermine the critical values of plasma beta and spectral slope that enable\nefficient electron acceleration via LHDI by comparing the rate of growth of\ninstability and the damping rate of the resulting fluctuations. We further\nanalyze the time evolution of the electron distribution function to confirm\nthese critical conditions. Our results indicate that electron acceleration is\ngenerally most efficient in low-beta plasmas ($\\beta < 1$). However, the\npresence of suprathermal electrons significantly enhances electron acceleration\nvia LHDI, even in high-beta plasmas ($\\beta > 1$). Finally, we discuss the\nastrophysical implications of our findings, highlighting the role of LHDI in\nelectron acceleration across diverse plasma environments."}

In this study, we present a comprehensive\nstatistical analysis of X-ray flares from 315 GRBs observed by the Swift/X-ray\nTelescope over nearly two decades. We categorize flares into prompt flares\n(occurring during the prompt emission phase) and afterglow flares and compare\ntheir temporal and luminosity properties. Our analysis reveals that both types\nof flares exhibit similar morphological characteristics, with prompt flares\nbeing brighter and occurring earlier than afterglow flares. We find strong\ncorrelations between flare parameters, such as peak time, duration, and\nluminosity, which follow consistent patterns across both flare types.

Interestingly, we found\nthat there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the\nbinding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter.\nThe inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase\ntransitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned\nquasi-universal relation."}

The\ncatalog provides intrinsic and extrinsic source parameters, signal-to-noise\nratios, parameter uncertainties, sky localization areas, and kilonova apparent\nmagnitudes in LSST filters. Our results show that third-generation detector\nnetworks substantially increase detection rates and improve parameter\nestimation. Second-generation detectors, when combined with third-generation\nones, significantly enhance sky localization and distance precision,\nparticularly for BNS mergers. Assuming a simplified Target of Opportunity\nstrategy, we estimate that an LSST-like survey, partnered with the CE+ET+LVK\nnetwork at 70% duty cycle, could detect about 5000 kilonovae with GW\ncounterparts over a 10-year period on a 16000 deg^2 footprint, predominantly\nfrom low-mass BNS mergers that produce long-lived supermassive neutron star\nremnants. While this is a substantial number, it represents only a small\nfraction of the total neutron star mergers expected to be observed by\nthird-generation networks. These projections rely on several simplifying\nassumptions-including the adopted merger rate, the kilonova luminosity\ndistribution, and the configuration and scheduling of future surveys-which\nintroduce notable uncertainties.

Accepted for publication in Astronomy &\n  Astrophysics", "summary": "Numerous astrophysical shock waves evolve in an environment where the\nradiative cooling behind the shock affects the hydrodynamical structure\ndownstream, thereby influencing the potential for particle acceleration via\ndiffusive shock acceleration (DSA).\n  We study the possibility for DSA to energize particles from the thermal pool\nand from pre-existing cosmic rays at radiative shocks, focusing on the case of\nsupernova remnants (SNRs). We rely on a semi-analytical description of particle\nacceleration at collisionless shocks in the test-particle limit, estimating the\ntotal proton and electron content from SNRs throughout the radiative phase. Our\nresults indicate that DSA can lead to significant particle acceleration during\nthe first few tens of kyrs of the radiative phase. Although the associated\nmulti-wavelength emission from SNRs in the radiative phase may not be\ndetectable with current observatories in most cases, the radiative phase is\nfound to lead to substantial deviations from the canonical p$^{-4}$ of the\ntest-particle limit. The hardening/steepening is due to an interplay between a\ngrowing contribution of the reaccelerated term as the SNR volume expands and\nthe effects of adiabatic and radiative losses on trapped particles as particles\nare confined for a longer time. The slope of the cumulative proton and electron\nspectra over the SNR lifetime thus depends on the environment in which the SNR\nshock propagates, and on the duration of the radiative phase during which DSA\ncan take place. Overall, DSA in the radiative phase can lead to a total\nelectron spectrum steeper than the proton spectrum, both at SNRs from\nthermonuclear and core-collapse SNe. Finally, we comment on the case of young\nradiative SNRs (in the first month to a few years after the explosion) for\nwhich the denser environments (with mass-loss rates of $\\dot{M} \\sim 10^{-1} -\n1$ M$_{\\odot}$/yr) tend to inhibit DSA."}

Here we focus on double degenerate systems, where two WDs are\ninteracting, and on the double detonation mechanism, where a detonation of a\nhelium shell triggers a detonation of the carbon-oxygen core of the primary WD.\nWe take the results from three-dimensional SN simulations of Pakmor et al 2022\n(arXiv:2203.14990) and carry them into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, until\n1500 yr after the explosion. We reveal signatures of the SN imprinted in the\nSNR morphology. We confirm the impact of a companion on the SNR: its presence\ninduces a conical shadow in the ejecta, that is long lived. Its intersection\nwith the shocked shell is visible in projection as a ring, an ellipse, or a\nbar, depending on the orientation. New, we test the case of a nested explosion\nmodel, in which the explosion of the primary induces the secondary to also\nexplode. As the explosion of the secondary WD is weaker only the primary outer\nejecta interact with the ambient medium and form the main SNR shell. The\nsecondary inner ejecta collide with the reverse shock, which enhances the\ndensity and thus the X-ray emissivity. The composition at the points of impact\nis peculiar, since what is revealed are the outer layers from the inner ejecta.\nThis effect can be probed with spatially-resolved X-ray spectroscopy of young\nSNRs."}

However, uncertainties and\ndegeneracies-where different parameter sets produce similar light curves-make\nthis task challenging. We propose a deep learning framework for inferring\npulsar parameters from observed light curves. Traditional deep learning models\nare not designed to produce multiple degenerate solutions for a given input. To\naddress this, we introduce a custom loss function that incorporates a light\ncurve emulator as a forward model, along with a dissimilarity loss that\nencourages the model to capture diverse, degenerate parameter sets for a given\nlight curve. We further introduce a test-time optimization scheme that refines\npredicted parameters by minimizing the discrepancy between the observed light\ncurve and those reconstructed by the forward model from predicted parameters\nduring inference. The model is trained using a suite of state-of-the-art\nsimulated pulsar light curves.

We\nsimultaneously characterize the transition in the distribution of BBH\nmass-ratios, effective aligned and effective precessing spins using our\nflexible models.
