For drift-scanning arrays, robustly calibrating the data is especially challenging due to the lack of the ability to track a calibration source. Consequently, calibration strategies for drift-scanning arrays are limited by our knowledge of the radio sky at large, as well as the direction-dependent instrument response. In the context of 21 cm cosmology, where small calibration errors can conspire to overwhelm the cosmological signal, it is therefore crucially important to develop calibration strategies that are capable of accurately calibrating the data in the presence of sky or instrument modeling errors. In this paper we present CorrCal, a covariance-based calibration strategy for redundant radio interferometric arrays. CorrCal is a hybrid calibration strategy that leverages the strengths of traditional sky-based calibration and redundant calibration in a computationally efficient framework that is fairly insensitive to modeling errors. We find that the calibration errors from CorrCal are unbiased and far below typical thermal noise thresholds across a wide range of modeling error scenarios. We show that CorrCal is computationally efficient: our implementation is capable of evaluating the likelihood and its gradient in less than a second for 1,000-element class arrays using just a single laptop core. Given CorrCal's computational efficiency and robustness to modeling errors, we anticipate that it will serve as a useful tool in the analysis of radio interferometric data from current and next-generation experiments targeting the cosmological 21 cm signal."}

Elson"], "title": "A Demonstration of a Neural Network as a Bridge Between Galaxy Simulations and Surveys", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper demonstrates that the stellar masses of galaxies in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, originally derived via stellar population synthesis modelling, can be accurately predicted using only their absolute magnitudes and colour indices. A central contribution of this work is the demonstration that this long-standing inference problem can be solved using an exceptionally simple machine-learning model: a fully connected, feed-forward artificial neural network with a single hidden layer. The network is trained exclusively on synthetic galaxies generated by the SHARK semi-analytic model and is shown to transfer effectively to real observations. Across nearly 3.5 dex in stellar mass, the predicted values closely track the GAMA SED-derived masses, with a typical scatter of ~0.131 dex. These results demonstrate that complex deep-learning architectures are not a prerequisite for robust stellar mass estimation, and that simulation-trained, lightweight machine-learning models can capture the dominant physical information encoded in broad-band photometry. The method is further applied to 17,006 GAMA galaxies lacking SED-derived masses, with photometric uncertainties propagated through the network to provide corresponding error estimates on the inferred stellar masses. Overall, this work establishes a computationally efficient and conceptually transparent pathway for simulation-to-observation transfer learning in galaxy evolution studies."}

This results in entire optical/digital systems, which are traditionally designed sequentially, i.e. , the adaptive optics system is optimised first, and the restoration algorithms are designed a second time. Studies on optical/digital systems have shown that jointly optimizing the whole system is a better alternative. We propose to extend these co-design strategies to the design of an adaptive optics-assisted imaging system. We derive a simple criterion that takes into account the source properties and the entire optical/ digital system performance. To illustrate its interest, we use it to optimize the wavelength distribution between the wavefront sensor and the imaging camera. In addition, we explore the potential of using multiple imaging channels operating at different wavelengths as a means of making an imaging system robust to turbulence strength and source magnitude variations. Later, any parameter of the optical/digital system, if not the entire system itself, could be optimized this way."}

The aim of this work is to develop and characterize a modernized standard neutron monitor based on a CHM-15 boron thermal neutron counter and a data acquisition system designed for marine expeditionary studies of cosmic ray variations. Modern nuclear physics experimental methods and the principles of microprocessor-based data acquisition systems were used to solve this problem.

In the soft X-ray spectra, absorption by interstellar gas can result in deep absorption features that affect continuum measurements. In this paper, we focus on measuring the abundance of interstellar iron and neon from the column densities observed in soft spectra from XMM-Newton and Chandra for various low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), which allows for a direct probe of elemental abundances. As a noble gas, neon will not deplete into solid form, thus providing a benchmark with abundances determined via UV spectroscopy. We find that, when assuming Fe is 90\\% depleted into grains, [Fe/Ne]$ = -0.523\\pm0.025$, [Fe/H]$ + 12 = 7.482\\pm0.016$, and [Ne/H]$ + 12 = 8.012\\pm0.022$, which are the tightest observational constraints on these abundances to date, while being consistent with literature which uses protosolar abundances.

Following an object-oriented approach, the physical entities are modeled as processing objects connected to each other to exchange data objects. A simulation is run by providing its description instead of writing and executing a specific script. The Python language and its library flexibility allowed us to write one single code that can be run on CPU and GPU platforms. We put a strong focus on computational efficiency, relying on CuPy and its interface to access the CUDA-stream mechanism. Moreover, SPECULA is capable of distributed computations over multiple processing nodes, making it suitable to run in an HPC environment, as tested on the Italian supercomputer Leonardo. SPECULA can also be used in laboratory environment to implement a hybrid simulation, allowing us to interface simulated and concrete objects: this feature was demonstrated in the Adaptive Optics laboratories at Arcetri Observatory. In this paper, we describe the main characteristics of SPECULA, show some relevant examples of its use, and finally draw our goals for the future."}

We analyze our model results in conjunction with a review of other relevant theoretical possibilities existing in the literature. We found that modern neutron star observations seem to favor the existence of some type of exotic matter in the neutron star cores; in particular, our slow stable hybrid star scenario remains a proposal capable of satisfying these constraints. However, due both to the existing skepticism regarding some of the adopted hypotheses in most extreme neutron star measurements and to the precise adjustment needed for the equation-of-state parameters, significant tension and open questions remain."}

Most emit primarily above 0.3 keV in X-rays, but cooler thermal sources peaking in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) would be much more difficult to detect due to astronomy's critical blind spot in EUV. Here, we report the discovery of a remarkable new class of luminous, point-like, non-nuclear X-ray objects in galaxies-hypersoft X-ray sources -- that have been missed by all previous surveys to date. Detected primarily or exclusively below 0.3 keV, with 0.15-0.3 keV to 0.3-1.0 keV photon ratios >8, the most luminous examples radiate >1E38 erg/s in the narrow X-ray band, with spectral models indicating even greater bolometric luminosities, largely emitted in the EUV. They rank among the most energetic sources in galaxies, yet their EUV-peaking spectra evaded earlier detections. We propose that hypersoft sources are X-ray binaries spanning multiple physical classes, including accreting white dwarfs or post-nova systems-potential Type Ia supernova progenitors-and systems hosting accreting black holes. Beyond their elusive nature, they may play crucial role in ionizing gas within galaxies."}

With its wide-field, sensitive all-sky monitoring, the Einstein Probe (EP) has greatly increased the discovery rate of eFXTs. The search and identification of the optical counterparts of eFXT are vital for understanding their classification and constraining their physical origin. Yet, a considerable fraction of eFXTs still lack secure classifications due to the absence of timely follow-up observations. We carry out a systematic search of publicly available optical survey data and transient databases (including the Zwicky Transient Facility, ZTF, and the Transient Name Server, TNS) for optical counterparts to eFXT candidates detected by EP. In this paper, we describe our ongoing program and report the first results. Specifically, we identified the eFXT EP240506a to be associated with a UV/optical counterpart, AT 2024ofs. Spectroscopy of its host galaxy with VLT yields a redshift of $z = 0.120 \\pm 0.002$. By combining archival survey data with early-time multiwavelength observations, we find that the luminosity and light-curve evolution of AT~2024ofs are consistent with a core-collapse supernova origin.

In such an interaction, the nuclei in the CSM can undergo diffusive shock acceleration and reach very high energies. We consider such a model, which includes magnetic field amplification from the non-resonant streaming instability, enhancement to the abundance of heavy-ions, and composition-dependent acceleration.

It exhibits two key anomalies: an insufficient rotational energy loss rate to power its observed X-ray luminosity, and a braking index of $ = 1.08\\pm 0.04$, which starkly contradicts the canonical magnetic dipole value of $n=3$. To explain these anomalies, we develop a unified spin-evolution model that self-consistently integrates magnetic dipole radiation, gravitational wave emission, and wind braking. Within this framework, we constrain the wind braking parameter to $κ\\in [13, 37]$ from the nebular properties, finding it contributes substantially (17%-51%) to the current spin-down torque. Bayesian inference reveals that the birth period is poorly constrained by present data and is prior-dependent, indicating a millisecond birth is allowed but not required. Furthermore, we constrain the number of precession cycles to $ξ\\sim 10^{4}$--$10^{5}$, and our analysis favors a toroidally-dominated internal magnetic field configuration as the most self-consistent explanation for the low braking index. Finally, we assess the continuous gravitational-wave detectability. The present-day signal is undetectable. However, the early-time signal might have reached the projected sensitivity of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories, such as the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (aLIGO) and the Einstein Telescope (ET), although a confident detection would require exceptionally stable rotation, an assumption considered highly optimistic for a young magnetar.

A New Morphological Study of Tidal Disruption Event Host Galaxies", "comment": "20 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "Host galaxies of tidal disruption events (TDEs) show enhanced central stellar concentration and are preferentially found in post-starburst and green valley populations. This connection has led to the proposal that TDE host galaxies likely have gone through recent mergers. We conduct a new morphological study of 14 TDE host galaxies, using the r-band images from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), and Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), with the images from the latter two surveys having much higher depth and resolution than SDSS. We examine galaxy structures using conventional methods and also apply diagnostics of merger activity from machine learning models. Consistent with previous studies, our results show that TDE host galaxies are ~16% more centrally concentrated when compared to non-TDE-host controls. However, surprisingly, TDE hosts lack any indication of recent merger activity from both morphological analysis and our machine learning merger classifier. Instead, our results reveal that TDE host galaxies are approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times more likely to have bar-like or ring-like structures than their controls. This enhancement is even more prominent for TDEs in the green valley, with the factor reaching almost 3. Based on these results, we propose that bar-driven secular evolution, instead of merger, likely dominates the recent evolution of TDE hosts found in the green valley, which can simultaneously explain their distinctive nuclear properties and enhanced TDE rates."}

Constraining the contribution of thermal and non-thermal optical emission", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A. 10 pages (+5 pages of Appendix), 13 figures", "summary": "The quasar OP 313 was discovered in December 2023 in very-high-energy $γ$ rays above 100 GeV, enabling for the first time a complete characterization of its emission. However, the lack of updated measurements of its accretion disk, broad line region and dusty torus hampers a detailed interpretation of the role of accretion in the observed $γ$-ray production. We intend to characterize, during high-activity states, the external photon fields contributing to the IR-to-UV emission$-$namely dusty torus, broad line region and accretion disk$-$and investigate potential variability and blurring effects on the broad emission lines. We present new spectroscopic observations of OP 313 with the NOT and TNG telescopes to characterize its optical spectrum and variability with respect to archival observations from SDSS. We measure the luminosity of different broad emission lines, characterizing the broad line region, accretion disk and dusty torus. We measure the Mg II emission line, with an average flux of $F_{\\mathrm{Mg \\ II}} = (0.85 \\pm 0.11)\\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Its equivalent width and luminosity are consistent with a constant line with a variable non-thermal continuum. From the stable Mg II line we derive a constant luminosity of the thermal components, $\\log(L_{\\mathrm{BLR}} \\ \\mathrm{[erg \\ s^{-1}]}) = 44.91 \\pm 0.19$, $\\log(L_{\\mathrm{disk}} \\ \\mathrm{[erg \\ s^{-1}]}) = 45.91 \\pm 0.19$ and $\\log(L_{\\mathrm{torus}} \\ \\mathrm{[erg \\ s^{-1}]}) = 44.70 \\pm 0.16$, and estimated a BH mass of $\\log(M_{BH}/M_{\\odot})=8.36 \\pm 0.18$, in line with with that derived from the C III] line. These characteristics and the indicator of the accretion rate from the disk/Eddington luminosity ratio $λ=L_{AD}/L_{Edd} = 0.23 \\pm 0.10$, along with a high Compton dominance, favour a FSRQ-like nature, contrary to the argued changing-look nature."}

Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "Mapping the physical conditions of the shocked plasma of young supernova remnants (SNR) is crucial for understanding their explosion mechanisms, ejecta structure, and large-scale asymmetries. Using $>350$ ks of XRISM/Resolve high spectral resolution observations of Cassiopeia A (Cas A), the youngest known Galactic core-collapse SNR, we present the first microcalorimeter-based plasma parameter maps of any SNR. We tessellate Cas A into $1'\\times1'$ regions and fit the broadband spectra as thermal emission from two pure-metal ejecta components -- corresponding to intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) and iron-group elements (IGEs) -- plus nonthermal synchrotron radiation. For robust inference, we introduce UltraSPEX, a Bayesian framework that couples the SPEX plasma code with the UltraNest nested-sampling algorithm, yielding full posterior distributions and exploration of parameter degeneracies. Key findings include enhanced Ar/Si and Ca/Si abundance ratios near the base of the Si-rich jets, and a high Ni/Fe mass ratio ($0.08\\pm0.015$) in the base of NE jet. IGEs ejecta exhibit systematically higher Doppler velocities and broadenings than IMEs ejecta in most regions, with maximum differences of $\\sim800$ km/s and $\\sim1200$ km/s, respectively; Ca shows distinct (faster) kinematics from other IMEs in several SE regions. The ionization timescale and electron temperature show a robust anti-correlation, particularly for IGEs. This relation and measured parameter values could be explained by semi-analytical models with significant ejecta clumping (overdensities of $\\sim10$ for IGEs and up to $\\sim100$ for IMEs) and reduced historical reverse-shock velocities. Nonthermal emission accounts for a substantial fraction, with at least 47% of the 4--6 keV continuum and dominates in the western regions, where the spectrum hardens."}

Comments welcome. Main arguments presented in Sections 1,2,5&6", "summary": "We revisit the spectral appearance of extended self-gravitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Using dust-poor opacity tables, we show that all optically thick disk solutions possess a universal outer effective temperature of $T_{\\rm eff}\\sim 4000-4500$K, closely resembling compact, high-redshift sources known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Assuming the extended disk is primarily heated by stellar sources, this ``disk Hayashi limit\" fixes the dominant optical continuum temperature of the disk spectrum independent of accretion rate $\\dot{M}$, black hole mass $M_\\bullet$, and disk viscosity $α$, and removes the parameter-tuning required in previous disk interpretations of LRDs. We construct global self-gravitating accretion disk models with radially varying accretion rates, suggesting that burning of embedded stellar objects can both efficiently power the emission of the outer disk and hollow out the inner disk, strongly suppressing variable UV/X-ray associated with a standard quasar. The resulting disk emission is dominated by a luminous optical continuum while a separate, non-variable UV component arises from stellar populations on the nuclear to galaxy scale. We map the optimal region of parameter space for such systems and show that LRD-like appearances are guaranteed for $\\dot{M}/α\\gtrsim 0.1 M_\\odot /{\\rm yr}$, a threshold insensitive to $M_\\bullet$, below which the system may transition into classical non-self-gravitating AGN disks, potentially a later evolution stage. We expect this transition to be accompanied by the enhancement of metallicity and production of dust, giving rise to far infrared emission. This picture offers a physically motivated and quantitative framework connecting LRDs with AGNs and their associated nuclear stellar population."}

These measurements form the basis for solving the inverse problem of determining the cosmic ray anisotropy vector beyond the magnetosphere. To support such studies, periodic latitude measurements are necessary to determine the coupling functions of primary and secondary cosmic rays variations. The aim of this work is to develop and characterize a modernized standard neutron monitor based on a CHM-15 boron thermal neutron counter and a data acquisition system designed for marine expeditionary studies of cosmic ray variations. Modern nuclear physics experimental methods and the principles of microprocessor-based data acquisition systems were used to solve this problem. The results of test trials and of continuous monitoring showed that the characteristics of the upgraded and standard neutron monitor are similar, and the ease of use, compactness, and stability allow us to conclude that the mobile neutron detector can be used in expeditionary conditions with limited access for maintenance personnel."}
