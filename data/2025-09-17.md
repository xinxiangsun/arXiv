### [1] [Systematic Effects of Chaotic Magnetic Fields on Neutron Star Tidal Deformability: Implications for Gravitational Wave Constraints on Dense Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12246)
*Debarshi Mukherjee*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 本文研究了强磁场对中子星物质状态方程的影响及其对双中子星合并中潮汐形变测量的影响，采用混沌磁场近似方法解决了磁场各向异性问题，发现磁场会使中子星半径和潮汐形变参数增加，这些效应可能被当前和下一代引力波探测器探测到。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决先前磁化中子星研究中磁场各向异性在TOV方程中的处理问题，探索强磁场对中子星状态方程和潮汐形变测量的系统性影响。

Method: 采用混沌磁场近似方法，结合相对论平均场方法，自洽处理磁压同时保持各向同性，计算了磁场强度从10^15到10^16 G的中子星质量-半径关系和潮汐形变参数。

Result: 磁场使中子星半径增加0.8-2.3%，潮汐形变参数增加4.2-18.1%，效应近似按B^1/2标度。对于1.4倍太阳质量的中子星，潮汐形变参数从无磁场时的678×10^6增加到B=10^16 G时的803×10^6。

Conclusion: 磁场效应在使用引力波观测约束中子星状态方程时必须考虑，特别是对于包含高度磁化中子星的群体。当前GW170817对潮汐形变的约束可能需要系统性修正，研究提供了磁场修正的标度关系并讨论了下一代探测器对中子星合并群体研究的影响。

Abstract: We investigate the effects of strong magnetic fields on the equation of state
(EoS) of neutron star matter and the resulting implications for tidal
deformability measurements in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. A critical
issue with previous magnetized neutron star studies is the treatment of
magnetic field anisotropy in the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. To
address this fundamental problem, we employ the chaotic magnetic field
approximation, which allows for a self-consistent treatment of magnetic
pressure while maintaining isotropy. Using a relativistic mean field approach
with properly implemented magnetic field corrections, we compute mass-radius
relations and tidal deformability parameters for neutron stars with magnetic
field strengths ranging from $10^{15}$ to $10^{16}$ G. Our systematic study
reveals that magnetic fields induce increases in both stellar radii
(0.8--2.3\%) and tidal deformabilities (4.2--18.1\%) compared to field-free
cases, with effects scaling approximately as $B^{1/2}$. These modifications,
while modest, are potentially detectable with current and next-generation
gravitational wave detectors. For a canonical $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star, the
tidal deformability increases from $\Lambda_{1.4} = 678 \times 10^6$ in the
absence of magnetic fields to $\Lambda_{1.4} = 803 \times 10^6$ for $B =
10^{16}$ G. We demonstrate that magnetic field effects must be considered when
constraining the neutron star equation of state using gravitational wave
observations, particularly for populations including highly magnetized neutron
stars. Our results suggest that the current GW170817 constraint on tidal
deformability may require systematic corrections when accounting for magnetic
field effects. We provide scaling relations for magnetic field corrections and
discuss the implications for population studies of neutron star mergers with
next-generation detectors.

### [2] [Star-Black Hole Interactions in Young Star Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12318)
*Sara Rastello,Giuliano Iorio,Mark Gieles,Long Wang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 在致密年轻星团中，恒星与黑洞的近距离相遇会引发微潮汐瓦解事件，通过N体模拟发现多数事件源于多体相互作用，年发生率约350-450 Gpc⁻³ yr⁻¹，未来可通过光学和引力波观测探测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究致密年轻星团中恒星与黑洞近距离相遇产生的微潮汐瓦解事件的物理机制和观测特征

Method: 使用PETAR进行直接N体数值模拟，分析多体相互作用过程

Result: 发现大多数微潮汐瓦解事件源于多体相互作用，推断发生率为350-450 Gpc⁻³ yr⁻¹，LSST预计每年可观测10-100个事件，引力波信号在deci-Hertz波段可被未来探测器探测

Conclusion: 微潮汐瓦解事件是年轻星团中的重要物理过程，未来可通过光学巡天和引力波观测联合探测这类事件

Abstract: Close encounters between stars and black holes can trigger micro-tidal
disruption events (micro-TDEs) in dense young star clusters (YSCs). Using
direct N-body simulations with PETAR, we found that most micro-TDEs arise from
few-body multiple encounters. The inferred rate is approximately 350-450
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Micro-TDEs could be detected both by upcoming surveys
such as LSST, expected to observe roughly 10-100 events per year, and by their
gravitational-wave (GW) signals peaking in the deci-Hertz band, detectable with
future instruments such as LGWA and DECIGO.

TL;DR: 该研究报道了两个超新星SN 2023wdd和SN 2022acrv的观测，它们代表了氢包层质量介于IIb型和短平台型超新星之间的过渡类型，具有极短平台期(10-20天)和混合光谱特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氢丰富超新星的光变曲线形态随氢包层质量的减少呈现连续变化，但IIb型和短平台型超新星之间的观测边界尚未明确定义和观测到。

Method: 通过广泛的光度和光谱观测，结合解析激波冷却模型和数值光变曲线拟合，估算氢包层质量，并与已知的IIb型、短平台型和II型超新星进行比较。

Result: 发现SN 2023wdd和SN 2022acrv具有约0.6-0.8太阳质量的氢包层，显著大于典型IIb型但符合短平台型预测阈值，证实了氢包层质量与平台期长度之间的单调关系。

Conclusion: 这些发现为氢丰富核心坍缩前身星的包层剥离提供了连续分布的额外证据，并将这两个超新星定位在IIb/短平台边界上。

Abstract: Hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) span a range of hydrogen envelope masses at
core collapse, producing diverse light curves from extended plateaus in Type II
SNe to double-peaked Type IIb SNe. Recent hydrodynamic modeling predicts a
continuous sequence of light-curve morphologies as hydrogen is removed, with
short plateau SNe (plateau durations ~50--70 days) emerging as a transitional
class. However, the observational boundary between IIb and short-plateau
remains poorly defined, and thus far unobserved. We report on extensive
photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of SN 2023wdd and SN 2022acrv,
candidate transitional events on the low-mass end of the short-plateau class.
Both exhibit weak, double-peaked light curves which we interpret as
exceptionally short plateaus (10--20 days), and hybrid spectral features:
persistent H$\alpha$ absorption with He I contamination, but without the helium
dominance characteristic of IIb SNe. Using analytic shock-cooling models and
numerical light curve fitting, we estimate hydrogen-rich envelope masses of
~0.6--0.8 $M_\odot$ -- significantly larger than canonical IIb values
($\lesssim0.1\,M_\odot$) but consistent with the ${\sim}0.9\,M_\odot$ threshold
predicted for short-plateau behavior. Although the progenitor radii inferred
from analytic and numerical methods differ by factors of 2--5, envelope mass
estimates are consistent across approaches. Comparisons to well-studied IIb (SN
2016gkg, SN 2022hnt), short-plateau (SN 2023ufx, SN 2006ai, SN 2016egz, SN
2006Y), and II SNe (SN 2023ixf, SN 2013ej) suggest a monotonic relationship
between hydrogen envelope mass and plateau length consistent with analytic and
numerical expectations. These findings provide additional evidence for a
continuous distribution of envelope stripping in hydrogen-rich core-collapse
progenitors and place SN 2023wdd and SN 2022acrv along the IIb/short-plateau
boundary.

### [4] [The Photospheric Emission of a Short-Duration Gamma-Ray Burst Emerging from a Realistic Binary Neutron Star Merger](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12505)
*Nathan Walker,Davide Lazzati,Tyler Parsotan,Rosalba Perna*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过经典的二元中子星合并模拟研究，使用PLUTO流体动力学代码和MCRaT辐射转移代码，首次实现了对实际二元中子星合并产生的电磁信号的现实处理，包括轴上和离轴观测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GRB170817A和GW170817的同时检测推动了对二元中子星合并的研究，但这些爆发的辐射机制仍存在开放性问题。需要通过更现实的模拟来理解其电磁信号特征。

Method: 使用PLUTO流体动力学代码在3D二元中子星合并模拟的抛出物中注入相对论伐射流，然后使用MCRaT辐射转移代码对伐射流中的提示光学层辐射进行建模，包括轴上和离轴观测。

Result: 发现轴上辐射的光谱峰值在~1MeV左右，离轴观测时显著减弱。在不同观测角度下发现明显的非热低能和高能尾部。轴上结果符合短时间爆发的Amati相关性，但在更大观测角度下出现一定紧张。辐射效率远低于以前长时间爆发光学层辐射研究的结果。

Conclusion: 这项研究首次提供了来自现实二元中子星合并的电磁信号模拟，为理解短时间累金射线爆发的辐射机制提供了重要见解。结果显示了观测角度对光谱特征的显著影响，并发现短时间爆发的辐射效率较低，这与长时间爆发存在明显差异。

Abstract: The almost simultaneous detection of GRB170817A and GW170817 ushered in
nearly a decade of interest in binary neutron star mergers and their
multi-messenger signals, resulting in a greater understanding of the processes
that produce short-duration gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves. However,
open questions remain regarding the emission mechanism of these bursts. In this
work we present results from the first study of an electromagnetic signal
produced from a realistic treatment of a binary neutron star merger, both for
on-axis and off-axis observations. We accomplish this by using the PLUTO
hydrodynamical code to inject a relativistic jet into the ejecta of a realistic
binary neutron star merger, which was itself obtained from the simulation of a
3D BNS merger. Then, we model the prompt photospheric emission that would
emerge from this jet using the MCRaT radiative transfer code. We find that the
resulting photon spectra can peak around ~1 MeV for on-axis emission and falls
off noticeably for off-axis observations. We also find distinctly non-thermal
low and high-energy tails in multiple observations, ranging from shallow to
mid-off axis observations. Our on-axis results are consistent with the Amati
Correlation for short bursts, with some strain evident at higher observing
angles. Finally, we find that the radiative efficiency is much lower than seen
in previous studies of the photospheric emission of long-duration gamma-ray
bursts.

TL;DR: 本文综述了IceCube和KM3NeT中微子望远镜在探测极高能中微子方面的最新进展，包括探测器设计、性能比较、近期高能事件发现以及未来观测前景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着中微子天文学的发展，探测PeV级及以上能量的极端高能中微子对于理解宇宙射线起源、天体物理源种群和宇宙学中微子具有重要意义。需要比较不同探测器的性能和技术特点。

Method: 通过回顾IceCube（南极冰下）和KM3NeT（地中海）两种中微子望远镜的探测器架构设计，分析它们捕获切伦科夫光的原理，比较它们在PeV级及以上能量中微子探测中的读出和重建性能。

Result: 发现了多个重要的高能候选事件：KM3NeT在2023年观测到约120 PeV的μ子径迹；IceCube检测到数个PeV级的簇射和径迹事件。这些发现揭示了不同探测器观测到的事件特征存在明显差异。

Conclusion: 极高能中微子观测领域正在快速发展，不同探测器的互补观测为理解极端能量中微子的起源和性质提供了重要信息。未来观测将有助于揭示天体物理源种群特征和宇宙学中微子的奥秘。

Abstract: We review the state of the art in the detection of extreme high-energy
neutrinos, focusing on the IceCube and KM3NeT neutrino telescopes. IceCube,
operating deep in Antarctic ice, and KM3NeT, a new array in the Mediterranean
Sea, employ distinct designs to capture Cherenkov light from neutrino
interactions. We examine their detector architectures, readout and
reconstruction performance for PeV-scale and higher-energy neutrinos. Recent
candidate events above 5 PeV are highlighted. These include a ~120 PeV muon
track observed by KM3NeT in 2023, and IceCube's highest-energy detections,
which comprise several-PeV showers and tracks. We outline current approaches to
neutrino energy reconstruction and explore scenarios that might explain the
apparent differences in observed event characteristics. Finally, we summarize
future prospects for extreme-energy neutrino observations and their
implications for astrophysical source populations and cosmogenic neutrinos.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 本文通过脉冲叠加方法系统分析了毫秒脉冲星的轮廓稳定时间尺度，发现稳定轮廓需要平均10^5-10^6个脉冲，为PTA实验中的抖动噪声提供了实用估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫秒脉冲星轮廓稳定性是实现高精度计时和探测纳赫兹引力波的关键因素，需要定量分析其稳定时间尺度以指导PTA实验。

Method: 使用基于脉冲叠加的直接方法，分析uGMRT（300-750 MHz）和Parkes UWL（704-4032 MHz）的多历元观测数据，研究9个毫秒脉冲星3-5年的数据。

Result: 发现稳定时间尺度取决于信噪比、脉冲形态和表面磁场强度，轮廓稳定性斜率与抖动参数存在强相关性，可作为脉冲形状内在变化的有效代理。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个新颖且可扩展的框架来评估轮廓内在变异性，有助于指导积分时间选择和减少PTA实验中的计时噪声。

Abstract: Pulse profile stability in millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is a key factor in
achieving high-precision timing essential for detecting nanohertz gravitational
waves with Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). In this work, we present a systematic
analysis of profile stabilization timescales in MSPs using a direct method
based on pulse stacking, applied to long-term multi-epoch observations. Our
study utilizes data from the upgraded GMRT (uGMRT) between 300--750 MHz for
nine MSPs over 3--5 years and Parkes Ultra-Wideband low-frequency receiver
observations (Parkes UWL; covering 704--4032 MHz) for three of them. We find
that stable profiles typically require averaging over $10^{5}$--$10^{6}$
pulses. This is the first time such a quantitative approach has been applied to
MSPs across a wide frequency range, providing an indirect but practical
estimate of jitter noise, a dominant noise source in PTA datasets. We observe
that stabilization timescales depend on signal-to-noise ratio, pulse
morphology, and surface magnetic field strength, with a moderate correlation
indicating a possible role of the magnetic field in emission stability. A
complementary single-epoch analysis of nine bright MSPs with uGMRT Band-3
(300--500 MHz) reinforces these results and demonstrates the method's
applicability to broader MSP populations. We show that a strong correlation
exists between profile-stability slope and the jitter parameter, implying that
for faint MSPs, profile-stability analysis can act as an effective proxy for
intrinsic pulse-shape variability. Our work provides a novel and scalable
framework to assess intrinsic profile variability, helping to guide integration
time choices and reduce timing noise in PTA experiments.

TL;DR: 本研究首次基于中微子和伽马射线联合模拟，评估了CTAO与KM3NeT协同观测高能天体物理源的性能，重点关注低光度源探测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同时观测伽马射线和中微子能够独特地探测超高能环境中的粒子加速和相互作用机制，需要评估下一代观测设施CTAO与KM3NeT的协同探测能力。

Method: 基于KM3NeT发现潜力应用中微子选择过滤器识别可观测源，然后模拟CTAO的伽马射线可探测性，考虑可见性、灵敏度和河外背景光吸收等因素。

Conclusion: KM3NeT与CTAO之间的协调多信使策略对于最大化天体物理中微子源的发现潜力至关重要。

Abstract: The simultaneous observation of gamma rays and neutrinos from the same
astrophysical source offers a unique opportunity to probe particle acceleration
and interaction mechanisms in ultra-high-energy environments. The Cherenkov
Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is a next-generation ground-based gamma-ray
facility, sensitive to energies from 20~GeV to 300~TeV. In this work, we
present for the first time a performance study of CTAO based on joint
simulations of steady-state sources emitting both neutrinos and gamma rays,
under the assumption that neutrino events are detected by the KM3NeT telescope
in the Northern Hemisphere. To identify potentially observable sources, we
apply a neutrino-based selection filter according to KM3NeT's discovery
potential. We then simulate gamma-ray detectability with CTAO, taking into
account visibility, sensitivity, and extragalactic background light absorption.
The analysis is specifically focused on exploring the detectability of sources
at low neutrino luminosities, limited to values below
$10^{52}\,\mathrm{erg\,yr^{-1}}$, in order to assess the performance of CTAO
and KM3NeT in identifying faint extragalactic emitters. Particular attention is
given to the strategic role of KM3NeT's geographic location, which provides
access to Southern-sky sources, and to the impact of the planned CTA+ upgrade,
which will enhance CTAO-South with Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs). Our results
highlight the importance of coordinated multi-messenger strategies between
KM3NeT and CTAO to maximize the discovery potential of astrophysical neutrino
sources.

TL;DR: 对13个z>4.5的明亮类星体进行X射线变异性系统分析，发现高红移类星体在小时-天和星期-月时间尺度上均表现出X射线变异性，且短时变异性占主导。发现X射线光度均值与标准差存在线性相关，支持局域随机磁重联机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高红移(z>4.5)类星体的X射线变异性特征，探索其物理机制，并与低红移活动星系核进行比较，了解宇宙早期超大质量黑洞的吸积过程。

Method: 结合2021-2023年Swift观测和存档多时期观测数据，使用Kaplan-Meier估计器方法包含光度测量的上限值，分析X射线光度的时间变异性。

Result: 发现高红移类星体存在短时和中期X射线变异性，短时变异性占主导；X射线光度均值与标准差存在线性相关；发现J090630+693030有182.46天周期，J143023+420436有16.89天周期；支持磁重联机制解释变异性。

Conclusion: 局域随机磁重联机制是高红移类星体X射线变异性的主要驱动机制，该机制可产生尺度不变的能量分布并解释σ-μ相关性，与低红移AGN的rms-flux关系平行，表明磁重联机制在高低红移AGN中均驱动短时X射线变异性。

Abstract: We present a systematic analysis on the X-ray variability in 13 bright
quasars at z > 4.5, combining recent Swift observations from 2021 to 2023 and
archival multi-epoch observations. Upper limits of the luminosity measurements
were included in the analysis by using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method. It is
found that the high-z quasars exhibit X-ray variability on both short-term
(hours-to-days) and intermediate-term (weeks-to-months) timescales, with
short-term variability dominating the overall variation. A linear correlation
exists between the global mean ($\mu_{\mathrm{L_{2-10\,keV}}}$) and standard
deviation ($\sigma_{\mathrm{L_{2-10\,keV}}}$) of X-ray luminosities, which is
independent of the X-ray photon index and optical-to-X-ray spectral slope. The
localized stochastic magnetic reconnection mechanism is strongly favored, which
can naturally lead to a scale-invariant power-law energy distribution and
satisfactorily explain the correlation. The $\sigma$-$\mu$ correlation
parallels with the well-documented rms-flux relation of low-z active galactic
nuclei (AGNs), implying the magnetic reconnection mechanism could drive
short-timescale X-ray variability in both high- and low-z AGNs. The highest-z
quasar in our sample, J142952+544717 (z = 6.18), shows a luminosity
distribution extending to ${10}^{47}\ \rm{erg\ {s}^{-1}}$ with a not
conspicuous median luminosity. On the other hand, J143023+420436 (z = 4.7),
which hosts the most relativistic jet among known high-z blazars, is dominated
in the high-luminosity regime (${10}^{47}\ \rm{erg\ {s}^{-1}}$ ), making it an
ideal target for multi-wavelength follow-up observations. J090630+693030 is
found to have a rest-frame period of 182.46 days and J143023+420436 has a
period of 16.89 days, both could be explained by the global evolution of
plasmoid chains, in which magnetic islands formed during reconnection may merge
successively.

### [9] [Probing the millisecond pulsar origin of the GeV excess in the Galactic Centre with LISA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12998)
*Valeriya Korol,Andrei Igoshev*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 本文探讨了利用LISA引力波观测来探测银河系中心毫秒脉冲星双星群的可能性，以验证其对GeV伽马射线超量的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 银河系中心的GeV伽马射线超量现象尚未得到解释，虽然暗物质湮灭是主要解释之一，但毫秒脉冲星群的可能性尚未被排除。由于电磁观测在银心区域受到散射、高天空温度和源混淆等限制，需要寻找独立验证方法。

Method: 构建了两种毫秒脉冲星-白矮星双星合成群体模型：吸积情景（来自被破坏的球状星团）和原位形成情景（通过孤立双星演化）。分析LISA对这些系统的探测能力。

Result: 两种情景下只有10^{-5}--10^{-4}的底层群体可被LISA探测到，但即使几个探测也意味着存在数万到数十万个未观测系统。吸积双星具有较低啁啾质量（~0.4 M⊙），而原位双星产生更重的伴星（~0.9 M⊙）。

Conclusion: LISA能精确测量双星频率，但啁啾质量测量仅限于最大质量或最高频率系统。区分毫秒脉冲星双星与更常见的双白矮星具有挑战性，但LISA探测可为平方公里阵列后续观测提供有价值目标，从而关键验证毫秒脉冲星对伽马射线超量的起源解释。

Abstract: The GeV $\gamma$-ray excess observed towards the Galactic Centre remains
unexplained. While dark matter annihilation has long been considered a leading
interpretation, an alternative scenario involving a large population of
millisecond pulsars has not been ruled out. Testing this hypothesis with
electromagnetic observations is difficult, as pulsar searches in the bulge are
strongly affected by scattering, high sky temperature, and source confusion. We
investigate whether gravitational-wave observations with the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could provide an independent probe of the
millisecond pulsar binary population in the Galactic bulge.
  We construct synthetic populations of millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries
under two illustrative formation scenarios: an accreted scenario, in which
systems are deposited by disrupted globular clusters, and an in situ scenario,
in which binaries form through isolated binary evolution. In both cases, only
$10^{-5}$--$10^{-4}$ of the underlying bulge population is detectable by LISA.
Nevertheless, even a few detections would imply tens to hundreds of thousands
of unseen systems. Accreted binaries are expected to have lower chirp masses
($\sim$0.4 M$_\odot$), while in situ binaries produce more massive companions
($\sim$0.9 M$_\odot$).
  LISA will measure binary frequencies with high precision, but chirp masses
can only be determined for the most massive or highest-frequency systems.
Distinguishing millisecond pulsar binaries from the far more numerous double
white dwarfs will be challenging, though LISA detections could provide valuable
targets for follow-up with the Square Kilometre Array, enabling a critical test
of the millisecond pulsar origin of the $\gamma$-ray excess.

TL;DR: IceCube利用地表和深冰探测器同时测量宇宙射线空气簇射中的低能和高能μ子，通过双分量横向分布函数重建初级能量和低能μ子数，用于分析宇宙射线成分和检验强子相互作用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IceTop没有专门的μ子探测器，难以测量单个空气簇射中的低能μ子成分，需要开发新方法来同时重建初级能量和低能μ子数。

Method: 使用电磁和μ子横向分布函数的解析描述相结合的双分量横向分布函数方法，在单个事件基础上同时重建初级能量和低能μ子数。

Result: 该方法能够利用Sibyll 2.1、QGSJet-II.04和EPOS-LHC等强子相互作用模型进行μ子数重建。

Conclusion: 双分量横向分布函数方法为IceCube观测站提供了有效的工具，可用于宇宙射线成分分析和强子相互作用模型测试。

Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, situated at the geographic South Pole,
comprises both a surface component, IceTop, and a deep in-ice component. This
unique setup allows for simultaneous measurements of low-energy ($\sim
\rm{GeV}$) and high-energy ($\gtrsim 400\,\rm{GeV}$) muons generated in
cosmic-ray air showers. The correlation between these low- and high-energy
muons can serve as a valuable tool not only for analyzing cosmic-ray
composition but also for tests of hadronic interaction models. However, IceTop
does not feature dedicated muon detectors, making it challenging to measure the
low-energy muon component for individual air showers. \\ \noindent For this
reason, a two-component lateral distribution function is utilized for the
simultaneous reconstruction of the primary energy and low-energy muon number on
a single-event basis. This is achieved by combining analytical descriptions of
the electromagnetic and muon lateral distributions. In this work, the
underlying principles of this method will be discussed, as well as its
capability for muon number reconstruction using the hadronic interaction models
Sibyll 2.1, QGSJet-II.04, and EPOS-LHC.

Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory actively participates in multimessenger
follow-ups of gravitational-wave (GW) events. With the release of the
Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogue (GWTC)-2.1 and -3, the sub-threshold GW
event information from the third observation run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK)
detectors is publicly available. These sub-threshold GWs are identified via
template-based and minimally modelled search pipelines. Neutrino counterparts
can enhance their astrophysical significance and improve their localisation. In
this contribution, we propose a catalogue-based search for sub-TeV neutrino
counterparts to sub-threshold GWs. For this search, we use archival data from
IceCube's dense infill array, DeepCore. Using the unbinned maximum likelihood
method, we search for correlation between IceCube sub-TeV neutrinos and the
$\sim$ 100 most significant sub-threshold GW source candidates. With this
study, we aim to contribute to the ongoing efforts to identify common
astrophysical sources of neutrinos and GWs. We present the current status of
this search and its role in advancing multimessenger astronomy, paving the way
for deeper exploration of GW events and their sources.

Abstract: The surface array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, IceTop, measures
cosmic rays in the PeV-EeV primary energy range. Stations comprising radio
antennas and scintillation detectors will be added to enhance the existing
surface detectors. A prototype station, consisting of eight scintillation
detectors and three radio antennas, has been in operation in with the
instrumentation in final design since the beginning of 2023. Radio signals from
air showers are measured by antennas that are read-out when the trigger
condition from the scintillation detectors is met. This contribution reports on
air-shower coincidence measurements of these radio antennas with IceTop.
Geometric shower parameters reconstructed from the radio antennas are compared
with those from IceTop to determine the angular resolution. We also present
details on the two new stations that were tested, deployed and commissioned
with their respective data acquisition systems during the latest field season
at the South Pole.

Conclusion: 这些结果推进了对脉冲星环境的理解，并为未来多波段和下一代伽马射线研究建立了框架

Abstract: Pulsars and their pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are unique laboratories for
extreme astrophysical processes. This dissertation combines Fermi-LAT
observations with a time-dependent leptonic PWN model (TIDE) to explore their
gamma-ray emission. The model was validated on benchmark PWNe and applied to a
systematic LAT search, leading to the discovery of new MeV-GeV candidates and
the first population-level characterization. Several sources were modeled in
detail, and predictions for potential TeV-emitting PWNe were tested against
current and future observatories. Ultra-high-energy gamma-ray sources were also
examined, revealing limits of standard leptonic scenarios. Beyond PWNe,
stringent upper limits were obtained for the binary pulsar 1A 0535+262, and
steady emission was detected from the globular cluster M5. Together, these
results advance our understanding of pulsar environments and establish a
framework for future multi-wavelength and next-generation gamma-ray studies.

TL;DR: 研究分析了食双星系统中X射线暴的再处理辐射，在EXO 0748-676和XTE J1710-281中发现了食出时的暴发事件，通过建模估计再处理比例并讨论了可能的再处理区域。

Motivation: 研究热核X射线暴的初级辐射与双星系统不同部分相互作用产生的再处理辐射，特别是在食双星系统中利用食相期间初级辐射被遮挡的特性来研究再处理辐射。

Method: 搜索RXTE档案数据中食双星系统的暴发事件，对EXO 0748-676和XTE J1710-281中发现的食出暴发进行建模分析，估计再处理比例和再处理区域大小上限。

Conclusion: 食双星系统中的X射线暴再处理辐射研究为了解双星系统结构和物质组成提供了重要信息，再处理可能发生在伴星剥离风、吸积盘和盘风中。

Abstract: The primary radiation from thermonuclear X-ray bursts observed in the neutron
star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) systems can interact with various parts of
the binary system. This interaction gives rise to secondary radiation in
different wavelength ranges, known as reprocessed emission. In eclipsing LMXBs,
the reprocessed emission from the bursts can be examined during eclipses, as
the primary emission is blocked and only the reprocessed emission is visible.
We searched for bursts during eclipses in the archival RXTE data of the
eclipsing LMXBs and found them in EXO 0748-676 and XTE J1710-281. In EXO
0748-676, seven bursts were found to occur near eclipse egress, with their
tails extending beyond the eclipse, and one such burst was found for XTE
J1710-281. We estimate the reprocessing fraction at orbital phases near eclipse
egress by modeling the peculiar eclipse bursts detected in both systems, which
have tails extending beyond the eclipses. We observe an increasing trend in
reprocessing fraction as these eclipse bursts occur closer to the eclipse
egress. We discuss the possibilities of reprocessing in the ablated wind from
the companion star, the accretion disc, and the disc wind in EXO 0748-676 and
XTE J1710-281. Additionally, we observe two decay components in the bursts in
EXO 0748-676, which could suggest a complex composition of the accreting fuel.
From the burst rise timescales, we place an upper limit on the size of the
reprocessing regions in both EXO 0748-676 and XTE J1710-281, finding it
comparable to the size of the respective X-ray binaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 天体环境中分子丰度的确定对于解释观测数据和约束物理条件至关重要，需要化学建模工具来模拟复杂的分子演化过程。

Method: 开发基于Python的SIMBA软件包，采用标准化速率方程方法，在指定物理条件下演化分子丰度，包含气相化学、颗粒表面过程和光化学，关键性能例程使用即时编译实现计算效率。

Result: 通过模拟外部FUV辐射驱动的光蒸发流中的化学演化，发现分子冰（特别是H2O等高结合能分子）在流动中的存活距离比静态模型预测的更远。

Conclusion: SIMBA是一个开源的天体化学建模工具，具有图形界面和高效性能，可用于研究复杂化学过程，并可扩展到更高维度建模。

Abstract: Determining molecular abundances in astrophysical environments is crucial for
interpreting observational data and constraining physical conditions in these
regions. Chemical modelling tools are essential for simulating the complex
processes that govern molecular evolution. We present SIMBA, a new Python-based
single-point astrochemical modelling package designed to solve chemical
reaction networks across diverse astrophysical environments. The software
follows standardised rate equation approaches to evolve molecular abundances
under specified physical conditions, incorporating gas-phase chemistry,
grain-surface processes, and photochemistry. While leveraging Python for
accessibility, performance-critical routines utilise just-in-time compilation
to achieve computational efficiency suitable for research applications. A key
feature of SIMBA is its graphical interface, which enables rapid investigation
of chemical evolution under varying physical conditions. This makes it
particularly valuable for exploring parameter dependencies and complementing
more computationally intensive multi-dimensional models. We demonstrate the
package's capabilities by modelling chemical evolution in a photoevaporative
flow driven by external FUV irradiation. Using simplified gas dynamics, we
chain multiple SIMBA instances to create a dynamic 1D model where gas evolves
both chemically and dynamically. Comparing this approach to typical static
models - where chemistry in each grid cell evolves independently - reveals that
molecular ices, especially those with relatively high binding energies like
H2O, can survive much farther into the flow than static models predict. This
example case highlights how SIMBA can be extended to higher dimensions for
investigating complex chemical processes. The package is open-source and
includes comprehensive documentation.

TL;DR: 对小行星2024 YR4的月球撞击风险分析及应对任务方案研究


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2024 YR4小行星存在约4%的月球撞击概率，可能产生大量月球溅射物，使低地球轨道微流星体碎片通量增加1000倍，威胁宇航员和航天器安全，需要研究应对任务方案

Method: 分析飞越和交会侦察任务、偏转任务、以及动能和核能强力摧毁任务，评估化学和太阳能电推进、各种运载火箭、优化的深空机动和引力辅助，考虑重新部署现有航天器和利用已建造但未发射的航天器

Result: 最佳侦察任务方案在2028年底发射，偏转任务不切实际，但动能强力摧毁任务可在2030年4月至2032年4月间发射，核能强力摧毁任务可在2029年底至2031年底间发射

Conclusion: 即使排除月球撞击风险，部署侦察任务对小行星进行特征描述仍具有重要价值，需要为可能的2032年撞击事件提前准备应对方案

Abstract: Near-Earth asteroid 2024 YR4 was discovered on 2024-12-27 and its probability
of Earth impact in December 2032 peaked at about 3% on 2025-02-18. Additional
observations ruled out Earth impact by 2025-02-23. However, the probability of
lunar impact in December 2032 then rose, reaching about 4% by the end of the
apparition in May 2025. James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations on
2025-03-26 estimated the asteroid's diameter at 60 +/- 7 m. Studies of 2024
YR4's potential lunar impact effects suggest lunar ejecta could increase
micrometeoroid debris flux in low Earth orbit up to 1000 times above background
levels over just a few days, possibly threatening astronauts and spacecraft. In
this work, we present options for space missions to 2024 YR4 that could be
utilized if lunar impact is confirmed. We cover flyby & rendezvous
reconnaissance, deflection, and robust disruption of the asteroid. We examine
both rapid-response and delayed launch options through 2032. We evaluate
chemical and solar electric propulsion, various launch vehicles, optimized deep
space maneuvers, and gravity assists. Re-tasking extant spacecraft and using
built spacecraft not yet launched are also considered. The best reconnaissance
mission options launch in late 2028, leaving only approximately three years for
development at the time of this writing in August 2025. Deflection missions
were assessed and appear impractical. However, kinetic robust disruption
missions are available with launches between April 2030 and April 2032. Nuclear
robust disruption missions are also available with launches between late 2029
and late 2031. Finally, even if lunar impact is ruled out there is significant
potential utility in deploying a reconnaissance mission to characterize the
asteroid.

TL;DR: 大型研究基础设施的开放访问并不自动带来科学权威的民主化，天文望远镜的使用和科学领导权高度集中在少数国家，东道国不一定能获得相应的领导地位


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型研究基础设施（LSRIs）的开放访问是否真正实现了科学权威的公平分配，以天文学为关键案例，检验国际访问机制对科学民主化的影响

Method: 构建1955-2025年的国家-年份数据集，将天文设施位置与出版物使用情况和作者角色关联，区分设施托管、使用和领导三个维度

Result: 发现使用和影响力高度集中在少数设施中心；科学领导权比访问或使用更不平等（基尼系数0.91 vs 0.85）；托管和领导权经常脱节；全球领导权从美国主导转向多中心体系

Conclusion: 国际访问本身不足以民主化科学，将参与转化为领导权需要国内PI项目、仪器和数据管道投资，以及更公平分配信用的治理模式

Abstract: Large-scale research infrastructures (LSRIs) are central to contemporary
science policy, combining massive capital investments with international access
regimes. Yet whether open access to these infrastructures translates into more
equitable scientific authority remains contested. Astronomy provides a critical
case: world-leading observatories are globally shared but embedded in specific
national contexts. We compile a novel country--year dataset (1955--2025)
linking the location of astronomical facilities with publication usage and
authorship roles. This enables us to distinguish between hosting, using, and
leading in telescope-based research. Our analysis reveals: (i) usage and impact
are heavily concentrated in a small number of facility hubs; (ii) scientific
leadership is even more unequal than access or usage (Gini coefficient 0.91 for
first/corresponding authorship versus 0.85 for facilities and usage); (iii)
hosting and leadership often decouple--countries such as Chile and South Africa
mediate large publication volumes without commensurate gains in leading roles;
and (iv) global leadership has shifted from U.S. dominance to a multi-hub
system centered in the United States, Western Europe, China, Japan, and
Australia. These findings challenge the assumption that international access
alone democratizes science. We argue that converting participation into
leadership requires domestic PI programs, investments in instrumentation and
data pipelines, and governance models that distribute credit more equitably.
The study highlights how the governance of LSRIs shapes global scientific
hierarchies and offers design principles for infrastructures that seek not only
to share data but also to broaden scientific authority.

TL;DR: 量子估计理论证明，通过干涉测量法估计两个不等亮度热源间距的极限保持恒定，可实现超分辨率。比较分析表明振幅干涉测量在无损耗情况下最优，而强度干涉测量在考虑光学损耗时具有竞争力。

Motivation: 解决高对比度目标的天文观测是基础但极具挑战性的任务，需要探索量子极限下的干涉测量性能。

Method: 使用量子估计理论分析两种主要恒星干涉测量方案：振幅干涉测量和强度干涉测量，特别关注用于系外行星探测的消零策略。

Result: 振幅干涉测量的消零策略在分离估计方面是量子最优的；强度干涉测量在无损耗情况下效果较差但考虑光学损耗时具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 大规模干涉测量技术有望推动高分辨率天文观测的发展，特别是在考虑实际光学损耗的情况下。

Abstract: Resolving high-contrast targets is a fundamental yet highly challenging task
in astronomy. Using quantum estimation theory, we demonstrate that the ultimate
limit for estimating the separation between two unequal-brightness thermal
sources via interferometry remains constant, enabling the potential for
superresolution. We give a comparative analysis of two primary stellar
interferometric schemes: amplitude interferometry and intensity interferometry.
Notably, the nulling strategy employed in amplitude interferometry, a
configuration specifically proposed for exoplanet detection by leveraging
destructive interference to suppress the brighter source, is quantum optimal
for separation estimation. While intensity interferometry is less effective
than amplitude interferometry in lossless scenarios and fails to achieve
superresolution, it becomes competitive when optical loss in large-scale
interferometry is considered. By applying these methodologies to modern stellar
interferometry, we highlight the promise of large-scale interferometry for
advancing high-resolution astronomical observation.

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于波前传感器数据的扰动观测器方案，用于同时感知大气湍流和结构振动，避免了传统方法需要额外加速度计的成本和安装问题。


<details>

Motivation: 未来大型望远镜的性能主要受限于大气湍流和光学组件结构振动，需要实时扰动信息来增强自适应光学系统的校正性能。现有系统需要结合波前传感器和加速度计，但安装和运行额外加速度计成本高昂。

Method: 提出了两种创新扰动观测器方案：1）基于卡尔曼滤波理论的多速率大气影响估计器，可整合自然导星和激光导星信号；2）基于高斯过程回归的结构扰动估计器，支持离线和在线配置。使用端到端自适应光学模型进行验证。

Result: 在基于甚大望远镜自适应光学设施真实数据的仿真中，所提出的扰动观测器方案显示出有希望的结果，能够有效估计湍流和振动信息。

Conclusion: 这些扰动观测器方案可以作为现有技术（如带卡尔曼滤波的线性二次控制器）的潜在替代或扩展方案，为未来大型望远镜提供更经济有效的扰动感知解决方案。

Abstract: The performance of future observatories such as the Extremely Large Telescope
is mainly limited by atmospheric turbulence and structural vibrations of the
optical assembly. To further enhance the mitigation performance of adaptive
optics, real-time information about the disturbances acting on the control loop
is needed. Current systems therefore employ a combination of wavefront sensor-
and accelerometer-based filters. In this work, methods using only data from
natural- and laser guide star (NGS, LGS) measurements are presented, as
telescopes like the Very Large Telescope already have multiple fast and
high-resolution wavefront sensors installed. This approach also avoids the
costly installation and operation of additional accelerometers on the optical
elements.
  We introduce two innovative disturbance observer schemes to sense both
turbulence and vibration information. A multi-rate estimator for atmospheric
influences is based on Kalman filter theory and can incorporate NGS and LGS
signals at different loop rates. The estimator for structural perturbations
uses Gaussian process regression and can be implemented in an offline and
online configuration. We validate the filter designs with data from a realistic
end-to-end adaptive optics model with randomly generated turbulence and
vibrations. The simulation is fed with on-sky data from the Adaptive Optics
Facility of the Very Large Telescope. The presented disturbance observer
schemes demonstrate promising results and may be considered as potential
alternatives or extensions to existing techniques such as linear-quadratic
controllers with Kalman filtering (LQG).

Motivation: 随着地面天文望远镜主镜尺寸增大到40米，抑制非大气扰动变得越来越重要。精确了解望远镜镜面运动对于理解和补偿基于振动的扰动至关重要。

Method: 基于VLT加速度计数据为每个单独镜面开发模型，使用von Karman风模型考虑风扰动影响，重点关注镜面的活塞、倾斜和偏转刚性体运动模态。通过比较测量和识别模态的功率谱密度进行验证。

Result: 研究表明所采用的方法适用于望远镜模态振动的识别，通过计算不同数据段的识别误差验证了方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这些发现将为大型望远镜（如线性二次高斯控制）开发先进的基于模型的自适应光学控制器提供重要基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in ground-based astronomy have made it possible to create
optical telescopes with primary mirrors up to 40 m in size. With growing mirror
diameter, the suppression of non-atmospheric disturbances becomes increasingly
important. Precise knowledge of the movement of telescope mirrors is essential
for understanding and compensating for vibration-based perturbations. A model
from VLT accelerometer data for each individual mirror is developed, while the
influence of wind buffeting is accounted for by a von Karman wind model. To
describe the relevant rigid body motion, we consider the piston, tip and tilt
modes of the mirrors. The identification is validated by comparing the power
spectral density of the measured and identified modes. Additionally, we assess
the robustness of the approach by calculating the identification error over
different sections of the data. The study indicates that the employed methods
are adequate for the identification of modal telescope vibrations. It is
anticipated that said findings will serve as a significant foundation for the
development of advanced model-based AO controllers for large telescopes, such
as linear quadratic Gaussian control.

Abstract: An international collaboration composed of Italian, Japanese, Spanish and
Swiss institutes, is developing the advanced camera (AdvCam), the
next-generation camera for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, designed
specifically for the Large-Sized Telescopes (LST) of the Cherenkov Telescope
Array Observatory. AdvCam incorporates cutting-edge Silicon Photomultipliers
(SiPMs) and a fully digital readout system, setting new standards for
performance and efficiency. The upgraded camera will feature four times more
pixels for the same field of view as the existing PMT-based camera, enabling
finer image resolution and significantly improving angular precision and
background noise rejection. To cope with the increase in number of pixels, many
technological challenges are being tackled, from low power and high speed
integrated chip design to real-time data processing on hardware accelerators.
This technological leap will lower the energy threshold by allowing operation
at lower observation threshold and providing brighter images. The increase in
effective area, angular and energy resolution will enhance the sensitivity,
unlocking new potential for gamma-ray astronomy. In this work, we present the
performance of the AdvCam's core building blocks and its innovative
architecture capable of enabling unprecedented triggering capabilities. We also
showcase the latest performance results based on Monte-Carlo data that has been
tuned to reflect the latest stages of the on-going technological developments,
highlighting the transformative capabilities of this next-generation
instrument.

Motivation: 现有校准方法未充分利用时间信息且对参考源阻抗匹配有假设限制，无法满足宇宙黎明和再电离时期中性氢信号探测所需的高灵敏度和稳定校准要求。

Method: 基于噪声波参数建立校准方程，在时间和频率维度上拟合多项式曲面，插值到天线测量时刻，并减少对参考噪声源和冷负载反射系数的假设。

Result: 新方法能有效消除时间漂移，将参数恢复至真实值的0.06%以内，验证源频谱的RMSE比先前方法降低97%，部分参数拟合误差减小6倍。

Conclusion: 该时间依赖的校准方法显著提高了校准精度和稳定性，为探测宇宙早期信号提供了更可靠的仪器校准解决方案。

Abstract: To achieve the sensitivity required to detect signals from neutral hydrogen
from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionisation it is critical to have a
well-calibrated instrument which has a stable calibration over the course of
the observation. Previous calibration methods do not explicitly use the time
information available and make assumptions on the impedance matching of the
reference sources. Here we present a new calibration method based on noise wave
parameters which fits a calibration solution over time and frequency to the
data, interpolating the solutions to the times at which the antenna is being
measured. To test this method we simulate a dataset using measurements of the
REACH receiver, modelling a low noise amplifier which is drifting over time.
Fitting a polynomial surface in frequency and time to the simulated data
demonstrates that we can remove the drift in the calibrated solution over time
but leaves a chromatic residual. We further show that we can remove assumptions
on the reflection coefficients of the reference noise source and the cold load,
reducing degeneracies in the parameter fits. Applying this new calibration
equation and surface fitting method to the simulated data removes the chromatic
residual in the calibrated spectrum and recovers the parameters to within 0.06%
of the truth and a 97% reduction in the RMSE of the spectrum of the validation
source compared with previous calibration methods. For two parameters we report
up to six times smaller fit error after the degeneracies are removed from the
time-based calibration.

program on Keck conducts 18+-1 hours per year of science observations; a
facilitized twilight observing program that is prioritized by the observatory
could yield 151+-2 hours of science time per year. This work presents the
scientific motivation and high-level feasibility of two primary SCALES twilight
science cases, monitoring of Solar System objects and a high-contrast imaging
search for exoplanets around bright nearby stars, taking lessons from the
existing NIRC2 and OSIRIS Twilight Zone program and considering increases in
program scope. We also consider technical and operational challenges to
overcome before the SCALES instrument begins its twilight observing program.

Abstract: Intensity interferometry (II) offers a powerful means to observe stellar
objects with a high resolution. In this work, we demonstrate that II can also
probe internal stellar kinematics by revealing a time-asymmetric Hanbury Brown
and Twiss (HBT) effect, causing a measurable shift in the temporal correlation
peak away from zero delay. We develop numerical models to simulate this effect
for two distinct astrophysical scenarios: an emission-line circumstellar disk
and an absorption-line binary system. Our simulations reveal a clear
sensitivity of this temporal asymmetry to the system's inclination angle,
velocity symmetry, and internal dynamics. This suggests that, with sufficiently
high time resolution, II can be used to extract quantitative information about
internal kinematics, offering a new observational window on stellar dynamics.

TL;DR: 光束交叉技术首次测试结果显示，在100-300秒时间尺度上能适度降低噪声并提高稳定性，但整体性能与标准指向相似，受天线仰角和边界层高度影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发光束交叉技术旨在减少微波辐射计校准中的残余对流层多普勒噪声，提高测量精度。

Method: 使用ESA的TDCS系统在Malargue进行测试，分析14个BepiColombo航天器跟踪通道数据，通过轨道确定过程提取多普勒残差来比较光束交叉技术与标准指向的性能。

Result: 光束交叉技术在100-300秒时间尺度上表现出适度的噪声降低和稳定性改善，但整体性能与标准指向相当。天线仰角和边界层高度是影响结果的关键因素。

Conclusion: 光束交叉技术在太阳合相期间具有潜在应用价值，但需要扩大数据集、重新理论研究和优化交叉高度选择过程来巩固结果。

Abstract: The beam-crossing is a novel technique aimed at reducing residual
tropospheric Doppler noise for microwave radiometer calibrations. In this work,
we report the findings of the first test of this technique using ESA's
Tropospheric Delay Calibration System (TDCS) at the complex in Malargue. The
data consists in 14 tracking passes of the BepiColombo spacecraft collected
between October 2023 and March 2024 during two separate test campaigns. We
analyzed the performance of the beam-crossing technique and compared it with
the nominal radiometer pointing through the analysis of the Doppler residuals
extracted from the orbit determination process. Results show that the
beam-crossing performed similarly to the standard pointing, with modest noise
reductions and improved stability only at time scales between 100 s and 300 s.
Key factors affecting the results include the antenna elevation and the
boundary layer height, indicating the need to revisit initial test assumptions,
which comprised a fixed boundary layer. Furthermore, comparing the
beam-crossing test results with those obtained during the first two BepiColombo
superior solar conjunction experiments highlights a potential application of
this technique during periods of solar conjunction. However, technical
challenges, adverse weather, and limited Ka-band transponder use, reduced the
number of analyzed tracking passes. Future studies should therefore expand the
dataset to consolidate the results. Furthermore new theoretical studies and
test campaigns should elaborate on the selection process for the optimal
crossing height.
