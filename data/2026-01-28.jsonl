Standard frequency-domain implementations, such as the FINDCHIRP algorithm, rely on streaming long template waveforms and data from main memory, which leads to significant processor stalling when template durations exceed cache capacities. In this work, we introduce \\textit{Ratio-Filter Dechirping} as a solution, an algorithmic restructuring of the matched filter that transforms the operation from a memory-bound Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into a cache-efficient, compute-bound Finite Impulse Response (FIR) convolution. By utilizing a reference template to remove common orbital phase evolution, we produce slowly changing frequency-domain ratios that can be accurately implemented as short FIR filters. This method delivers a measured speedup of $8\\times$ for the core filtering loop used in offline searches and should enable $>10\\times$ for low-latency analysis. We find that this approach generalizes to a variety of searches that include physical features such as finite size effects, eccentricity, and precession. By dramatically reducing the computational cost of matched filtering, this approach enables the expansion of searches into dense or high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as those for eccentric or subsolar-mass signals, that are already limited by available computing budgets. Furthermore, this framework provides a natural path for hardware acceleration on GPU architectures."}

Despite this progress, the physical interpretation of these populations remains severely limited, as precise constraints on planetary masses, interior structures, and atmospheres are available only for a small, highly selected subset of targets. As a result, most known exoplanets remain physically ambiguous, preventing the construction of robust population-level trends and limiting our understanding of planet formation, evolution, and habitability.\n  In the coming decades, missions such as PLATO, Earth 2.0, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will dramatically expand the number of exoplanets detected. However, without a corresponding capability to characterise planetary masses and atmospheres at scale, these discoveries will remain largely detection-driven. Current and planned facilities, including JWST and ELT-class instruments, excel at detailed studies of individual systems but are intrinsically unsuited for large, homogeneous surveys.\n  This white paper identifies population-level physical characterisation as a fundamental science challenge for the 2040s and motivates the need for a new observational paradigm. We outline how photonics-enabled, modular telescope architectures can deliver the survey speed, stability, and scalability required to jointly probe planetary interiors and atmospheres across statistically meaningful samples, thereby enabling a comprehensive and physically grounded understanding of planetary systems."}

Due to the low dark rate and read-noise free nature of MAMA detectors, observations of UV-dim sources can result in exposures with 0 or 1 counts in some pixels. In this regime, the \"root-N\" approximation widely used to calculate uncertainties breaks down, and one must compute Poisson confidence intervals for more accurate uncertainty calculations. The CalCOS pipeline was updated in 2020 to account for these low-count uncertainties. Here, we assess how STIS observations are currently affected by this phenomenon, describe a new Jupyter notebook exploring the issue, and introduce a new utility, stistools.poisson_err, to manually calculate Poisson confidence intervals for 1D STIS spectra. Additionally, we describe a related software bug in the stistools.inttag utility, which splits TIME-TAG data into sub-exposures. This newly fixed bug serves as a useful case-study for the proper use of Poisson confidence intervals."}

This paper presents detailed results of X-ray illumination tests of a 60-mm-diameter, full-circumference, double-reflection monolithic electroformed nickel mirror and its Mirror Module Assembly (MMA). The experiments were conducted at the 1-km beamline BL29XUL at SPring-8. To simulate a parallel X-ray beam from celestial sources, we constructed a dedicated evaluation system, the High-Brilliance X-ray Kilometer-long Large-Area Expanded-beam Evaluation System (HBX-KLAEES). Owing to the high photon flux and the quasi-point-like source with a small divergence provided by HBX-KLAEES, the imaging performance was evaluated with high fidelity, resolving both the sharp core and large-angle components of the Point Spread Function (PSF). The results show an extremely sharp core with a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 0.7 arcsec and a Half Power Diameter (HPD) of 14 arcsec, even after integration into the MMA. In addition, a positive correlation was found between angular resolution and axial figure error in both the primary and secondary mirror sections, indicating that axial figure errors contribute to image degradation. Based on these results, the MMA was selected as one of the hard X-ray optics for the FOXSI-4 sounding rocket experiment, which performs high-resolution soft and hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy of solar flares and was successfully launched. These results demonstrate the potential for further improvements in angular resolution and the development of high-resolution, ultra-short focal length X-ray optics for small satellites, including CubeSats."}

While in its L2 orbit, the satellite has been exposed to high energy cosmic rays and solar particles, that caused permanent damage to its CCDs. The main effect of radiation damage on Gaia data is the distortion of its images and spectra, caused by the CCDs charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) during the readout process, that, if not taken into account, can result in inaccurate measurements of a star's location and flux. In this work, the impact of CTI in the serial readout direction, larger than in the parallel due to the presence of CCDs manufacturing defects, has been analysed and modelled. A pixel-based, physically motivated CTI model, CtiPixel, has been developed to characterise the damage in Gaia CCDs. The model has been calibrated using dedicated serial CTI diagnostic data, taken every 3-4 months over the course of the mission. The model is shown to be a good representation of the observed signatures of CTI in the calibration datasets, and its parameters reveal significant insights into the nature of the CCD defects generated by space irradiation. The evolution of the damage in the serial direction shows a general small linear increase over time, with sudden step changes after strong solar flares and coronal mass ejections directed towards Earth. The serial CTI showed a further step increase as a consequence of the engineering CCD annealing experiment carried out after the completion of Gaia science observations."}

Applying this to fast radio bursts (FRBs) in magnetar magnetospheres, we find that the scattering--although suppressed by the magnetic field--inevitably enters the linear growth stage. The subsequent evolution bifurcates: full scattering occurs when the density exceeds a critical value, whereas below it the scattering saturates and the FRB can escape. This eases the tension with observations of compact emission regions and may explain the observed diversity, including the presence or absence of FRBs associated with X-ray bursts."}

X-rays are emitted from hot post-shock electrons, and soft X-ray photons are reprocessed into optical/UV emission in the cool downstream. This naturally explains two previously puzzling features: (i) the coordinated evolution of the optical and soft X-ray after day 20, (ii) the hard X-ray hump above 10 keV that disappears around day 15 as the Thomson optical depth transitions from $τ_T \\gg1$ to $τ_T \\sim 1$.\n  Our model is over-constrained, and it quantitatively reproduces the bolometric luminosity evolution, soft X-ray spectrum, and time-dependent soft/hard X-ray and soft X-ray/optical luminosity ratios. It also explains additional puzzles: X-ray fluctuations with $\\sim4-10$ day timescales arise from a global radiative shock instability, while the NIR excess and the apparent receding blackbody radius result from reprocessed X-rays in matter far from thermodynamic equilibrium. The radio is naturally explained as originating from a shock driven by the same ejecta in the more dilute CSM.

We validate RICK's correctness and performance against real observational data from both MeerKAT and LOFAR. Our results demonstrate that the HeFFTe-based implementation offers substantial performance advantages, particularly when running on GPUs, and scales effectively with large pixel resolutions and a high number of frequency planes.

Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations predict that electron acceleration in weakly magnetized shocks proceeds via small-angle scattering, leading to a maximum electron energy significantly below the Bohm limit. This upper bound manifests observationally as a characteristic synchrotron cutoff, providing a direct probe of the underlying acceleration physics. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows offer an exceptional laboratory for testing these predictions. Here, we model the spectral evolution of GRB afterglows during the relativistic deceleration phase, incorporating PIC-motivated acceleration prescriptions and self-consistently computing synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission. We find that low-energy bursts in low-density environments, typical of short GRBs, exhibit a pronounced synchrotron cutoff in the GeV band within minutes to hours after the trigger. Applying our framework to GRB 190114C and GRB 130427A, we find that current observations are insufficient to discriminate between PIC-motivated acceleration and the Bohm limit, primarily due to large uncertainties in the Fermi-LAT band. Nevertheless, future MeV-TeV afterglow observations can break model degeneracies and place substantially tighter constraints on particle acceleration in relativistic shocks."}

While some authors have found two or three groups of GRBs by analyzing only a few parameters, recent work identified five ellipsoidally-shaped groups upon considering nine parameters $T_{50}, T_{90}, F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, P_{64}, P_{256}, P_{1024}$. Yet others suggest sub-classes within the two or three groups found earlier. Using a mixture model of Gaussian factor analysers, we analysed 1150 GRBs, that had nine parameters observed, from the current Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) catalogue, and again established five ellipsoidal-shaped groups to describe the GRBs. These five groups are characterised in terms of their average duration, fluence and spectrum as shorter-faint-hard, long-intermediate-soft, long-intermediate-intermediate, long-bright-intermediate and short-faint-hard. The use of factor analysers in describing individual group densities allows for a more thorough group-wise characterisation of the parameters in terms of a few latent features. However, given the discrepancy with many other existing studies that advocated for two or three groups, we also performed model-estimated overlap-based syncytial clustering (MOBSynC) that successively merges poorer-separated groups. The five ellipsoidal groups merge into three and then into two groups, one with GRBs of low durations and the other having longer duration GRBs. These groups are also characterised in terms of a few latent factors made up of the nine parameters. Our analysis provides context for all three sets of results, and in doing so, details a multi-layered characterisation of the BATSE GRBs, while also explaining the structure in their variability."}

We quantify this behaviour using the PA variance ratio $\\mathcal{R}_ψ$ and explore the joint plane of measured linear polarisation fraction $Π_L$ versus PA variance to constrain the allowed parameter space of microshot number $N$, intrinsic PA dispersion $σ_ψ$, and intrinsic linear fraction $Π_{L,0}$ at fixed signal-to-noise.

Search for Transient Object in New observations using Known Sources (STONKS) is a near-real-time transient detection system for XMM-Newton offering the capability to detect transients in XMM-Newton observations at fainter fluxes than can be achieved with wide survey instruments. We present the transients detected with the STONKS pipeline found in an XMM-Newton multi-year heritage survey of the Galactic plane to identify and classify highly variable X-ray sources that have recently been reported in this region. We examined the alerts created by the STONKS pipeline from over 200 XMM observations of the Galactic plane, screening for instrumental effects. The 78 alerts associated with 70 real astrophysical sources were then subjected to further temporal and spectral analysis. From the 70 sources we identified, we were able to classify 32 with a high degree of confidence, including 7 X-ray binaries, 1 $γ$-Cas analogue, and 1 magnetar candidate. Of the 70 sources, 23 were detected for the first time in X-rays. This systematic analysis of publicly available data has shown the value and potential of STONKS in the application to XMM-Newton observations. It will enable the community to detect transient and highly variable sources at fainter fluxes than with any other X-ray transient detection systems."}

Black hole-neutron star binaries with even more symmetric mass ratios are expected to leave behind massive disks capable of driving bright electromagnetic transients like kilonovae. Currently, there is only a limited number of numerical-relativity simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers in this regime, which are vital for accurate gravitational waveform models and analytical fitting formulas for the remnant properties. Insufficient accuracy of these may lead to misclassification of real events and potentially missed opportunities to locate their electromagnetic counterparts. To fill this gap in the parameter space coverage, we perform simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers with mass ratios $q \\in \\{1, 1/2, 1/3\\}$. We find the gravitational waveform models do not show good agreement with the numerical waveforms, with dephasing at the level of around 1 rad at the merger. We find that the masses of the dynamical ejecta and disk are in good agreement with the available fitting formulas. The analytical formulas for the remnant black hole are in excellent agreement for the black hole mass, but are less accurate with the predictions for its spin. Moreover, we analyze the remnant disk structure and dynamics, deriving the rotation law and identifying global trapped $g$-mode density oscillations. We distinguish three types of accretion in the postmerger and find modulation of the accretion rate by the global oscillations of the disk. Finally, we model the kilonova emission these systems would produce and find that most of them are potentially detectable by Vera C. Rubin Observatory within four days after merger, and by DECam within two days after merger if located at a distance of 200 Mpc."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "The origin of accretion disc winds remains disputed to date. High inclination, dipping, neutron star Low Mass X-Ray Binaries (LMXBs) provide an excellent testbed to study the launching mechanism of such winds due to being persistently accreting and showing a nearly ubiquitous presence of highly-ionised plasmas. We aim to establish or rule out the presence of a wind in the high inclination LMXB 4U 1624-49, for which a highly ionised plasma has been repeatedly observed in X-ray spectra by Chandra and XMM-Newton, and a thermal-radiative pressure wind is expected. We leverage the exquisite spectral resolution of XRISM to perform phase-resolved spectroscopy of the full binary orbit to characterise the highly ionised plasma at all phases except during absorption dips. An outflow is clearly detected via phase-resolved spectroscopy of the source with XRISM/Resolve. Based on analysis of the radial velocity curve we determine an average velocity of ~200-320 km/s and a column density above 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. The line profiles are generally narrow, spanning from ~50 to ~100 km/s, depending on the orbital phase, pointing to a low velocity sheer or turbulence of the highly ionised outflow and a potential increase of turbulence as the absorption dip is approached, likely due to turbulent mixing. The line profiles, together with the derived launching radius and wind velocity are consistent with a wind being launched from the outskirts of the disc and without stratification, pointing to a thermal-radiative pressure origin."}

Through over 250,000 trajectory simulations, we establish sharp constraints on when Penrose extraction with escape to infinity succeeds. The mechanism requires that exhaust ejected inside the ergosphere carries negative Killing energy, which is kinematically accessible only via ultra-relativistic ejection deep within the ergosphere. We find that successful extraction with escape is statistically rare ($\\sim$1% in broad parameter scans) and is governed by strict thresholds: it requires high black hole spin (empirically $a/M \\gtrsim 0.89$) and ultra-relativistic exhaust velocity (onset at $v_e \\approx 0.91c$). When conditions are highly tuned to a specific \"sweet spot,\" success rates can reach 88.5%, representing a narrow extraction window rather than generic behavior. Furthermore, single-impulse thrust at periapsis achieves significantly higher cumulative efficiency ($η_{\\rm cum} \\approx 19\\%$) compared to continuous thrust ($\\sim$2--4%) due to path-averaging penalties. These constraints quantify the extreme fine-tuning required for material-based Penrose extraction, consistent with the astrophysical dominance of electromagnetic mechanisms.

Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "Supernovae characterized by enduring narrow optical hydrogen emission lines (SNe IIn) are believed to result primarily from the core-collapse of massive stars undergoing sustained interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). While the properties of SN IIn progenitors have relatively few direct constraints, the ongoing ejecta-CSM interaction provides unique information about late-stage stellar mass-loss preceding core-collapse. We present late-time X-ray and radio observations of four $\\geq$3000 day-old SNe IIn: SN 2013L, SN 2014ab, SN 2015da, and KISS15s. The radio and X-ray emission from KISS15s indicate a mass-loss rate of $\\rm{\\dot M\\sim4\\times 10^{-3}~{M_{\\odot}\\,yr^{-1}}}$ at $\\sim$450 years pre-supernova -- 2 orders of magnitude below earlier optical estimates (which probed the mass-loss immediately preceding the supernova). We find hints of a spectral inversion in the radio SED of KISS15s; a possible signature of a secondary shock due to a binary system or the emergence of a pulsar wind. For SN 2013L, we obtain a mass-loss rate of $\\rm{\\dot M\\sim2 \\times 10^{-3}~\\rm{M_{\\odot}\\,yr^{-1}}}$ at $\\sim$400 years pre-explosion based on the X-ray detection. For SN 2014ab and SN 2015da, we find a upper limits on the mass-loss rates of $\\rm{\\dot M<2\\times10^{-3}~M_{\\odot}\\,yr^{-1}}$ explosion at $\\sim$ 250 and 300 years pre-explosion, respectively. All four objects display mass-loss rates lower than estimates from earlier optical analyses by at least 1-3 orders of magnitude, necessitating a rapidly evolving progenitor process over the last centuries pre-explosion. Our analysis reveals how X-ray and radio observations can elucidate progenitor evolution when these objects have faded at optical wavelengths."}

Standard frequency-domain implementations, such as the FINDCHIRP algorithm, rely on streaming long template waveforms and data from main memory, which leads to significant processor stalling when template durations exceed cache capacities. In this work, we introduce \\textit{Ratio-Filter Dechirping} as a solution, an algorithmic restructuring of the matched filter that transforms the operation from a memory-bound Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into a cache-efficient, compute-bound Finite Impulse Response (FIR) convolution. By utilizing a reference template to remove common orbital phase evolution, we produce slowly changing frequency-domain ratios that can be accurately implemented as short FIR filters. This method delivers a measured speedup of $8\\times$ for the core filtering loop used in offline searches and should enable $>10\\times$ for low-latency analysis. We find that this approach generalizes to a variety of searches that include physical features such as finite size effects, eccentricity, and precession. By dramatically reducing the computational cost of matched filtering, this approach enables the expansion of searches into dense or high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as those for eccentric or subsolar-mass signals, that are already limited by available computing budgets. Furthermore, this framework provides a natural path for hardware acceleration on GPU architectures."}
