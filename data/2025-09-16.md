### [1] [Radiation GRMHD Models of Accretion onto Stellar-Mass Black Holes: II. Super-Eddington Accretion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10638)
*Lizhong Zhang,James M. Stone,Patrick D. Mullen,Shane W. Davis,Yan-Fei Jiang,Christopher J. White*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 本文通过GRMHD模拟研究超爱丁顿黑洞吸积过程，发现辐射压力支撑的厚盘结构、辐射驱动外流、低辐射效率等特征，并分析了强/弱喷流的不同观测特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究超爱丁顿吸积流的物理特性，理解不同磁场构型和黑洞自旋条件下辐射传输、外流形成和观测特征，为解释ULXs、小红点等天体现象提供理论依据。

Method: 采用广义相对论磁流体动力学(GRMHD)方程耦合角度离散化辐射传输的数值模拟，涵盖不同吸积率、黑洞自旋和磁场拓扑结构，并进行分辨率研究和与非辐射模型对比。

Result: 超爱丁顿吸积流形成辐射压力支撑的几何厚盘；内盘辐射驱动显著外流，形成锥形漏斗区导致低辐射效率；角动量主要由麦克斯韦应力输运；强喷流能有效清理漏斗区实现几何集束辐射，弱喷流则导致漏斗区遮蔽。

Conclusion: 超爱丁顿吸积流具有独特的辐射特性和外流结构，强/弱喷流产生截然不同的观测特征，这些模型适用于解释ULXs、小红点等多种天文系统的观测现象。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of super-Eddington black hole accretion
simulations that solve the GRMHD equations coupled with angle-discretized
radiation transport. The simulations span a range of accretion rates, two black
hole spins, and two magnetic field topologies, and include resolution studies
as well as comparisons with non-radiative models. Super-Eddington accretion
flows consistently develop geometrically thick disks supported by radiation
pressure, regardless of magnetic field configuration. Radiation generated in
the inner disk drives substantial outflows, forming conical funnel regions that
limit photon escape and result in very low radiation efficiency. The accretion
flows are highly turbulent with thermal energy transport dominated by radiation
advection rather than diffusion. Angular momentum is primarily carried outward
by Maxwell stress, with turbulent Reynolds stress playing a subdominant role.
Both strong and weak jets are produced. Strong jets arise from sufficient net
vertical magnetic flux and rapid black hole spin and can effectively evacuate
the funnel, enabling radiation to escape through strong geometric beaming. In
contrast, weak jets fail to clear the funnel, which becomes obscured by
radiation-driven outflows and leads to distinct observational signatures.
Spiral structures are observed in the plunging region, behaving like density
waves. These super-Eddington models are applicable to a variety of astronomical
systems, including ultraluminous X-ray sources, little red dots, and black hole
transients.

*Xiangli Lei,Qingwen Wu,Ya-Ping Li,Wei-Hua Lei*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 本文提出超新星潮汐瓦解（TDS）模型，解释高能核瞬变现象，比传统TDE更明亮且不受黑洞质量限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越来越多的模糊核瞬变现象（包括极端核瞬变）无法用传统的潮汐瓦解事件（TDE）解释，特别是对于高能量和超大质量黑洞的情况

Method: 通过流体动力学模拟研究超新星被超大质量黑洞潮汐瓦解的过程，分析吸积盘形成和吸积率变化

Result: TDS吸积盘呈现缓慢下降趋势，可持续数月到数十年。对于M_BH ≲ 10^7.5 M⊙的黑洞，峰值吸积率可超过爱丁顿极限；对于更大质量黑洞则保持亚爱丁顿水平

Conclusion: 该模型为在M_BH ≳ 10^8 M⊙星系中触发能量≥10^45 erg/s的TDE-like耀斑或开启变化外观活动星系核提供了机制

Abstract: An increasing number of ambiguous nuclear transients, including some extreme
nuclear transients, have been reported, which cannot be simply explained by the
tidal disruption event (TDE) due to their high energy and/or overmassive black
holes. Stars that form in or are captured by AGN disks will grow and migrate
inward, potentially exploding as supernovae once the inner cold accretion disk
disappears during the phase of AGN decay. We propose that tidal disruption of a
supernova (TDS) by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can produce nuclear
transients that are even more luminous than typical TDEs and are not limited by
the SMBH mass. In this scenario, the SMBH can capture the supernova ejecta,
which subsequently self-intersects and circularizes into an accretion disk.
Based on hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the accretion rate of the TDS
disk exhibits a slow decline that can last for months to decades. The peak
accretion rate of a typical core-collapse SN scenario can exceed the Eddington
limit for SMBHs with $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{7.5}\,M_\odot$, while it remains
sub-Eddington for more massive SMBHs. This model provides a mechanism for
triggering an energetic TDE-like flare with luminosity
\(\gtrsim10^{45}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}\) in galaxies with $M_{\rm
BH}\gtrsim10^{8}\,M_\odot$ or triggering turn-on changing-look AGNs.

### [3] [Probing Hernquist dark matter with black hole shadows: A comprehensive study of various accretions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11245)
*Yuxuan Shi,Hongbo Cheng*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究分析了施瓦西黑洞被Hernquist暗物质晕包围时的阴影成像特性，通过三种吸积模型发现暗物质参数显著影响光子环、透镜环和直接发射的区域与强度，黑洞阴影可作为探测超大质量黑洞周围暗物质分布的有力工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑洞阴影的外观特征在天文观测和理论分析中高度依赖于周围吸积物质的特性，此前尚未详细研究Hernquist暗物质晕对施瓦西黑洞观测特性的影响。

Method: 采用三种简化吸积模型：几何薄吸积盘、静态球对称吸积和下落球对称吸积，分析Hernquist暗物质晕参数对黑洞阴影成像的影响。

Result: 暗物质参数增加导致测量强度显著降低，光子球尺寸增大2%-30%；下落吸积的多普勒降频效应使阴影比静态情况更暗；直接发射对总观测强度贡献显著。

Conclusion: 黑洞阴影的观测特性能够有效区分超大质量黑洞周围不同的暗物质分布，为暗物质探测提供了新的手段。

Abstract: The appearance of a black hole shadow, in both astronomical observations and
theoretical analysis, depends critically on the properties of the surrounding
accretion. In this study, we analyse the emission and observational properties
of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Hernquist dark matter (DM) halo
by considering three simplified accretion models, which have not been
previously explored in such detail. Based on our findings, direct emission
contributes markedly to the whole observed intensity for a
Schwarzschild-Hernquist black hole encircled by a geometrically thin accretion
disk. The corresponding regions and measured intensities of the lensing ring,
the photon ring, and direct emission are sensitive to the parameters of the
Hernquist DM halo. Apart from disk accretion, we also study two spherical
accretion models: static and infalling. With increasing Hernquist DM
parameters, both models exhibit a significant decrease in the measured
intensity, yet the photon spheres are enlarged by an increase of $\sim2\%$ to
$\sim30\%$. Furthermore, Doppler de-boosting due to the infalling accretion
results in darker shadow images compared to static cases. By precising
visualisations of the shadows, our results suggest that the observational
characteristics of black hole shadows can serve as a powerful probe for
distinguishing between different DM distributions around supermassive black
holes.

### [4] [Hurst Index of Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curves and Its Statistical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11631)
*Ruo-Yu Guan,Feifei Wang,Yuan-Chuan Zou*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 对163个长时伽马暴进行去趋势波动分析，发现Hurst指数与爆发持续时间呈负相关，与峰值光子通量的相关性在短时标最强，表明时间相关性主要存在于快速变化成分中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伽马暴是宇宙中最强大的天体物理现象，其复杂多变的光变曲线反映了中心引擎的动力学特性。研究希望通过定量分析时间相关性来深入了解伽马暴的发射机制。

Method: 使用去趋势波动分析(DFA)方法计算163个BATSE探测的长时伽马暴的Hurst指数，并通过回归和相关分析研究Hurst指数与其他12个观测参数之间的统计相关性。

Result: 发现Hurst指数与爆发持续时间(T50, T90)呈负相关，与低能谱指数α呈负趋势。与峰值光子通量的相关性在64ms时标最强，在256-1024ms时标系统性减弱。

Conclusion: 时间相关性的持续性在伽马暴发射的快速变化成分中最为明显，这为理解伽马暴发射的时间结构及其与底层物理机制的潜在联系提供了新视角。

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) rank among the most powerful astrophysical phenomena,
characterized by complex and highly variable prompt emission light curves that
reflect the dynamics of their central engines. In this work, we analyze a
sample of 163 long-duration GRBs detected by the Burst and Transient Source
Experiment (BATSE), applying detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to derive the
Hurst index as a quantitative descriptor of temporal correlations in the light
curves. We further explore statistical correlations between the Hurst index and
12 other observational parameters through regression and correlation analyses.
Our results reveal anti-correlations between the Hurst index and the burst
durations (T50, T90), and a negative trend with the low-energy spectral index
\alpha. We also find that correlations with peak photon flux are strongest at
the shorter timescale (64 ms) and systematically weaken at longer timescales
(256-1024 ms), indicating that the persistence of temporal correlations is most
evident in the rapid variability component of GRB emission. The results offer
new perspectives on the temporal structure of the GRB emission and its
potential link to the underlying physical mechanisms driving these bursts.

### [6] [Angle-dependent hardening of the reprocessed spectra in ULXs powered by accretion onto neutron stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11682)
*Sricheta Karmakar,Alexander A. Mushtukov,Matthew Middleton*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 超临界吸积盘产生的辐射驱动外流影响X射线辐射的角度分布，导致几何束流效应，进而影响X射线脉冲星的视亮度、脉冲检测和光谱组成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究质量吸积率超过约10^19 g/s时，X射线脉冲星中辐射驱动外流对辐射角度分布和光谱特性的影响，特别是几何束流效应对观测特性的作用。

Method: 采用简化的外流几何模型，进行蒙特卡洛模拟，模拟由外流形成的吸积腔壁再处理辐射的光谱，仅考虑再处理辐射而不包括直接脉冲星辐射。

Result: 再处理辐射的光谱取决于中心引擎的实际光度、外流几何和视角（特别是后者），高能部分对视角变化敏感（低倾角时更硬），而软通量随倾角变化相对较小。

Conclusion: 该模型预测可变超亮X射线源应表现出强烈的高能角度敏感性，同时软波段变化相对温和，这自然出现在进动调制有效倾角的情况下。

Abstract: It is anticipated that mass accretion rates exceeding approximately
$10^{19}\,{\rm g\,s^{-1}}$ in X-ray pulsars lead to radiation-driven outflows
from super-critical accretion discs. The outflows launched from the disc
influence the angular distribution of X-ray radiation, resulting in geometrical
beaming. The beaming, in turn, impacts the apparent luminosity of the X-ray
pulsar, detectability of pulsations, and the spectral composition of the X-ray
flux. We employ a straightforward geometrical model of the outflows, perform
Monte Carlo simulations, and model the spectra of radiation, reprocessed by the
walls of the accretion cavity formed by the outflows. We consider the
reprocessed emission only; direct pulsar emission is not included in our
modelling. Our results demonstrate that the spectra of reprocessed radiation
depend on the actual luminosity of the central engine, the geometry of the
outflows, and the viewing angle - most notably on the latter, through changing
visibility of the hotter wall regions near the disc plane. The high-energy part
of the reprocessed spectrum depends strongly on viewing angle (harder at lower
inclinations), while the soft flux varies comparatively little with
inclination. In our model, this contrast is a prediction: variable
ultra-luminous X-ray sources are expected to exhibit strong high-energy angle
sensitivity together with comparatively modest soft-band variation, naturally
arising if precession modulates the effective inclination.

TL;DR: 利用ACT宙宮学实验进行毫米波激光观测，得到螺旋星在96GHz、148GHz和225GHz的流强上限，填补了螺旋星谱能分布知识空白


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波激光观测对理解激光发射机制至关重要，但相关观测数据少。尝试利用原本用于宙宙微波背景的ACT实验进行毫米波激光观测

Method: 开发了阶段解析地图制作方法和基于模板的原始数据时间流拟合方法，利用信号的周期性提高敏感度

Result: 获得螺旋星在96GHz、148GHz和225GHz的周期平均流强密度的95%置信上限分别为4.6mJy、4.4mJy和20.7mJy

Conclusion: 这些约束表明螺旋星在毫米波长不会显著平坦或反转，证明了未来一代CMB实验在短时间尺度天体现象搜索中的潜力

Abstract: Millimeter-wave observations of pulsars, while crucial for understanding
their emission mechanisms, remain scarce. We demonstrate that high-precision
cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments like the Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT), though designed for cosmology, offer a unique capability for
such time-domain science due to their high cadence and broad sky coverage in
millimeter bands. While previous ACT searches have focused on transients
lasting minutes or longer, we develop and validate analysis methods to search
for periodic, millisecond-scale transients, a capability not typically
associated with CMB experiments. We describe a phase-resolved mapmaking
approach, which leverages the known periodicity of the signal to enhance
sensitivity and offers advantages in diagnosing systematic errors. We also
introduce a template-based fit to the raw data timestreams that independently
validate our results. Applying these methods to estimate the millimeter flux of
the Crab Pulsar (PSR B0531+21), we derive 95% confidence upper limits of 4.6
mJy, 4.4 mJy, and 20.7 mJy on the pulsar's period-averaged flux density at 96
GHz, 148 GHz, and 225 GHz, respectively. These constraints fill a gap in our
knowledge of the Crab Pulsar's spectral energy distribution, suggesting that it
does not significantly flatten or invert at millimeter wavelengths. This work
demonstrates the potential for future searches of short-timescale astrophysical
phenomena with the next-generation CMB experiments like the Simons Observatory.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 通过种群合成模拟研究不同超新星机制对自透镜双星系统可观测种群的影响，重点关注质量间隙区域（2-5太阳质量）的致密天体分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自透镜系统为研究银河系致密天体种群提供了独特的观测窗口，特别是针对存在争议的质量间隙区域，需要了解不同超新星机制如何影响可观测系统的特性。

Method: 使用startrack和COSMIC种群合成代码，测试三种具有不同对流增长时间尺度（f_mix = 0.5, 1.0, 4.0）的超新星遗迹形成模型，模拟银河系盘和核球区域的自透镜双星系统。

Result: 延迟模型（f_mix=0.5）预测质量间隙区域的系统比例显著更高（某些巡天中高达10倍），所有模型都偏好低质心速度系统（v_cm≤20 km/s）。ZTF预计能发现几十个覆盖良好的系统，LSST和ZTF在银河系盘中预计能发现几十个符合探测标准的系统。

Conclusion: 自透镜观测有助于约束质量间隙这一争议性种群，不同超新星机制会产生明显不同的可观测系统特征，为理解致密天体形成和双星存活物理过程提供重要信息。

Abstract: Self-lensing (SL) in binary systems has the potential to provide a unique
observational window into the Galactic population of compact objects. Using the
$\mathtt{startrack}$ and COSMIC population synthesis codes, we investigate how
different supernova mechanisms affect the observable population of SL systems,
with particular attention to the mass gap (2$\mathrm{-}$5 M$_\odot$) in compact
object distributions. We test three supernova remnant formation models with
different convective growth timescales ($f_{\rm mix}$ = 0.5, 1.0, and 4.0),
simulating SL binary systems across the Galactic disk and bulge. We identify
distinct groupings of SL sources based on lens mass and Einstein crossing time,
clearly differentiating neutron star from black hole systems and close from
wide orbits. Notably, the delayed $f_{\rm mix} = 0.5$ model predicts a
significantly higher fraction of systems with lens masses in the mass gap
region (up to $\sim10$ times more for certain surveys), suggesting that SL
observations could help constrain this controversial population. Our analysis
reveals a strong preference for systems with low centre-of-mass velocities
($v_{\rm cm}\leq20$ km/s) across all models, resulting primarily from physical
processes governing compact object formation and binary survival. While many
potential detections will have limited observational coverage, ZTF is predicted
to yield several dozen well-covered systems that should enable detailed
characterization. When applying simple detection criteria including photometric
precision and signal-to-noise requirements, predicted rates decrease by
approximately two orders of magnitude, but still yield up to a few tens of
expected detections for LSST and ZTF in the Galactic disk population.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中子星的强引力会导致暗物质在其核心积累，从而影响中子星的宏观性质，需要研究这种影响的具体表现

Method: 通过分析WIMP暗物质粒子在含Δ超子的中子星中的积累，研究其对状态方程和恒星宏观性质的影响

Result: 暗物质的加入软化了状态方程，降低了最大质量、典型半径、典型潮汐形变和典型恒星的转动惯量，但提高了典型恒星的f模频率，并发现暗物质费米动量与典型恒星宏观性质之间存在立方相关性

Conclusion: 暗物质积累显著影响中子星的宏观性质，特别是发现暗物质费米动量与恒星性质存在立方相关关系，这对理解暗物质与致密天体的相互作用具有重要意义

Abstract: The strong gravitational pull of the neutron star leads to the accretion of
dark matter (DM) inside the core of the neutron star. The accretion of DM
affects the bulk properties of the neutron star. Here, we study how the
accretion of WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) dark matter particles
affects the $\Delta-$admixed hyperon star's bulk properties specifically mass,
radius, tidal deformability, $f-$mode frequency and moment of inertia. The
inclusion of dark matter softens the EOS (equation of state) and reduces the
maximum possible mass, canonical radius, canonical tidal deformability, and
moment of inertia of canonical star. However, the $f-$mode frequency of the
canonical star increases. We find a cubical correlation between the dark matter
fermi momenta $k_f^{DM}$ and bulk properties of canonical star.

TL;DR: 本研究首次利用档案数据和物理确定的SED处理方法，为513个Fermi亮BL Lac天体构建了近似平均态的宽带能谱分布，发现非爆发态下磁场较弱、耗散区较大，并揭示了Klein-Nishina抑制效应和粒子加速机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耀变体的非爆发态占据其生命周期的大部分时间，但以往研究主要集中在爆发态，对耀变体一般性质的研究很少，需要系统研究平均态下的物理特性。

Method: 使用档案数据，采用物理确定的SED处理方法，为513个Fermi亮BL Lac天体构建近似平均态的宽带能谱分布(SEDs)。

Result: 发现平均态下磁场强度比爆发态弱近一个数量级，耗散区尺寸更大；359个源存在Klein-Nishina抑制效应；能量依赖概率加速机制可能在BL Lac喷流中主导粒子加速。

Conclusion: 耀变体在平均态下具有更扩展、磁化程度较低的耗散区，Klein-Nishina效应显著影响逆康普顿散射，能量依赖概率加速是主要的粒子加速机制。

Abstract: The physics-determined broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
blazars have been widely used to study the property during their
flaring/outburst states, while the non-flaring state takes up most of their
lifetime and the general property of blazars has been barely discussed. In this
work, for the first time, we used the archival data and employed the
physics-determined SED processing method to form approximately average-state
SEDs for 513 \textit{Fermi} bright BL Lacs. In general, we found that the
magnetic field ($B$) is weaker than those obtained for flaring/outburst state
by nearly one order of magnitude, and the dissipation region size ($R$) is
larger than those obtained for flaring/outburst state, suggesting that the
dissipation region could be more extend and less magnetized. A correlation
between the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) peak frequency ($\log \nu_{\rm
ssc}$) against the synchrotron peak frequency ($\log \nu_{\rm sy}$) suggest
that the inverse Compton scattering of HBLs suffer a significant Klein-Nishina
(KN) suppression, we quantified the condition of KN suppression by determining
the critical synchrotron peak frequency ($\nu_{\rm sy}^{\rm c}$) and found 359
out of 513 sources in our sample suffer KN suppression. Furthermore, our
analysis of the relationship between synchrotron curvature ($1/b_{\rm sy}$) and
$\log \nu_{\rm sy}$ indicates that the energy-dependent probability
acceleration (EDPA) mechanism may dominate the particle acceleration in BL Lac
jets.

TL;DR: 对高同步峰耀变体PKS 2155-304的多波段光变和时变能谱研究，发现不同耀发状态下物理参数的显著变化，表明加速效率和磁化程度的变化驱动了波段依赖性耀发。


<details>

Motivation: 研究耀变体PKS 2155-304的多波段辐射特性，探究其辐射起源和不同耀发状态下的物理机制变化。

Method: 利用多波段数据构建光变曲线和时变能谱，使用贝叶斯块分割γ射线光变曲线定义不同状态，在同步自康普顿框架下建模能谱，采用神经网络代理加速参数推断。

Result: 发现不同耀发状态下物理参数显著变化：多波段耀发时磁场、电子光度、最大洛伦兹因子和多普勒因子显著不同；γ射线耀发时电子谱指数更硬；X射线耀发时磁场和最大洛伦兹因子更高且辐射区更致密；光学/UV耀发时多个参数变化但辐射区大小基本不变。

Conclusion: 喷流功率以电子主导，磁化程度在X射线耀发时上升，加速效率和磁化程度的变化是驱动PKS 2155-304波段依赖性耀发的主要原因。

Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of the temporal and spectral evolution of
the emission from the blazar PKS 2155-304, a high-synchrotron-peaked (HSP)
blazar. Using $\gamma$-ray, X-ray, optical/UV, and infrared data assembled from
the Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center, we constructed multi-band light
curves and temporally resolved spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of PKS
2155-304 to probe the origin of its emission. The light curves show significant
variability, with fractional variability peaking at 0.75 in X-rays, 0.4 in the
optical/UV, and 0.65 in $\gamma$-ray band-consistent with expectations for
HSPs. Segmenting the $\gamma$-ray light curve with Bayesian blocks, we defined
253 time-resolved epochs with adequate multi-band coverage and categorized them
into quiescent states (QS), multiwavelength flares (MWF), $\gamma$-ray flares
($\gamma$F), X-ray flares (XF), and optical/UV flares (OUF). Each SED is
modeled within a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) framework that
self-consistently evolves particle injection and cooling; a neural-network
surrogate is used to accelerate parameter inference. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests
reveal state-dependent parameter variations relative to QS: (i) during MWF, the
magnetic field B, electron luminosity $L_{e}$, maximum electron Lorentz factor
$\gamma_{max}$, and Doppler factor $\delta$ differ significantly; (ii) during
$\gamma$F, a harder electron index p is estimated; (iii) XF shows higher B and
$\gamma_{max}$ with a more compact emitting region; and (IV) during OUF,
changes in B, $L_{e}$, $\gamma_{max}$, $\delta$, and p are found while the
emitting-zone size remains approximately constant. The jet power is
electron-dominated (magnetic-to-electron power ratio
$\eta_{B}\simeq0.09-0.17$), with $\eta_{B}$ rising during XF. These results
suggest that variations in acceleration efficiency and magnetization drive
band-dependent flaring in PKS 2155-304.

experienced by astronauts during space missions, there is an emergent need for
accurately depicting the space radiation environment and predicting the
cosmic-ray flux in the heliosphere.
  Here we present a new effective and predictive model of solar modulation
which incorporates fundamental physics processes of particle transport such as
diffusion, convection, and adiabatic cooling to compute the energy spectrum;
and temporal evolution of cosmic radiation in the inner heliosphere.
  Empowered by this model and a time-dependent effective description of the
geomagnetic field, we will show our estimates of the dose rates experienced by
astronauts over time, as they orbit Earth onboard the International Space
Station and while travelling through interplanetary space.

Abstract: Understanding the formation and evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes
(BBHs) requires a thorough investigation of the key physical processes
involved. While one pathway involves the isolated evolution of massive binary
stars, affected by uncertain stages like core-collapse supernovae and common
envelope evolution, an alternative channel is dynamical formation in dense
stellar environments. Newtonian gravity has traditionally provided a robust and
computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale gravitational
interactions. However, accurately capturing close encounters and black hole
mergers necessitates the use of general relativity. This work focuses on
assessing the applicability of post-Newtonian gravity in bridging these
regimes, offering a physically insightful and computationally tractable
approach to modeling BBH formation in the gravitational-wave era of astronomy.

TL;DR: 本研究通过宽频带观测分析脉冲星射电辐射的频率依赖性变化，发现传统单一发射高度模型无法解释观测到的多样性行为，支持多高度发射的扇形束或斑块结构模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索脉冲星射电辐射的频率依赖性变化，评估传统的半径-频率映射(RFM)模型和扇形束模型是否能描述观测数据。

Method: 使用Murriyang(Parkes)望远镜704-4032 MHz宽频带观测100多个脉冲星，测量多强度级别的轮廓宽度，进行高斯分量拟合，利用像差-延迟效应估计发射高度，并与扇形束模型比较。

Result: 发现许多脉冲星轮廓随频率增加而变窄，但相当一部分显示相反趋势；高斯分量峰值位置基本不随频率变化，但分量宽度一般随频率增加而变窄；自转减速光度与轮廓变窄弱相关，但与发射高度无关。

Conclusion: 传统单一发射高度模型无法解释观测到的多样性行为，脉冲星束可能起源于多个高度的扩展区域，扇形束或斑块结构主导其频率演化，未来模型需要包含真实等离子体物理和多高度发射。

Abstract: Aims. We explore frequency-dependent changes in pulsar radio emission by
analyzing their profile widths and emission heights, assessing whether the
simple radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) or the fan beam model can describe the
data. Methods. Using wideband (704-4032 MHz) Murriyang (Parkes) observations of
over 100 pulsars, we measured profile widths at multiple intensity levels, fit
Gaussian components, and used aberration-retardation effects to estimate
emission altitudes. We compared trends in width evolution and emission height
with a fan beam model. Results. Similar to other recent studies, we find that
while many pulsars show profiles narrowing with increasing frequency, a
substantial fraction show the reverse. The Gaussian decomposition of the
profiles reveals that the peak locations of the components vary little with
frequency. However, the component widths do, in general, narrow with increasing
frequency. This argues that propagation effects are responsible for the width
evolution of the profiles rather than emission height. Overall, the evolution
of the emission height with frequency is unclear, and clouded by the
assumptions in the model. Spin-down luminosity correlates weakly with profile
narrowing but not with emission height. Conclusions. The classic picture where
pulsars emit at a single emission height which decreases with increasing
observing frequency cannot explain the diversity in behavior observed here.
Instead, pulsar beams likely originate from extended regions at multiple
altitudes, with fan-beam or patchy structures dominating their frequency
evolution. Future models must incorporate realistic plasma physics and
multi-altitude emission to capture the range of pulsar behaviors.

### [15] [Discovery of femto Gauss intergalactic magnetic fields towards Mkn 501](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11996)
*Matías Sotomayor Webar,Yosef Abed,Dieter Horns*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 通过分析费米伽马射线望远镜14年数据，首次发现Mkn 501活动星系核周围存在延展的次级伽马射线晕，为宇宙际磁场（IGMF）的存在提供了5σ显著性证据，测得磁场强度约为1.5×10⁻¹⁵ G，相干长度约10 kpc。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宇宙际磁场（IGMF）的存在尚未通过观测确认，其起源可能来自天体物理过程或早期宇宙相变遗迹。现有研究主要通过法拉第旋转测量设定上限，通过次级伽马射线非探测设定下限。

Method: 分析费米-LAT 14年数据和Swift-XRT/BAT数据，构建Mkn 501的同步自康普顿模型作为注入谱，使用ELMAG代码模拟不同磁场配置下的级联辐射，并将模板与费米-LAT数据进行拟合。

Result: 发现Mkn 501周围存在显著（≥5σ）的延展次级辐射，对应IGMF磁场强度为(1.5⁺¹·⁶₋₀.₆)×10⁻¹⁵ G，相干长度(10±3) kpc。源需要持续注入TeV伽马射线至少45000年。

Conclusion: 首次在费米-LAT数据中检测到显著的次级伽马射线，证实IGMF存在。等离子体加热效应在Mkn 501中可忽略，这与该源在级联辐射研究中具有最低注入功率的观测结果一致。

Abstract: The existence of intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMF) has so far not been
established through observations. The IGMF is expected to be generated either
via processes mainly connected to astrophysical processes or it could be a
relic of phase transitions in the early universe. Upper bounds to the average
field present are set via observations of Faraday rotation measure. Lower
bounds have been derived from the non-detection of secondary gamma-rays
possibly produced in electromagnetic cascades. We investigate the presence of
IGMFs by studying the GeV gamma-ray emission from the nearby blazar Mkn~501
($z=0.034$), searching for evidence of the extended halo expected to be
observed around the point source. We analyse 14 years of data from Fermi-LAT
and Swift-XRT/BAT to construct a time-average synchrotron-self Compton model
for the TeV spectrum of Mkn~501. This injection spectrum is used to simulate
the resulting cascade emission with the ELMAG code for different magnetic field
and coherence length configurations. These templates are fit to the Fermi-LAT
data to find a best-fitting model for the cascade emission. We find significant
($\ge 5 \sigma$ trial-corrected) evidence for extended secondary emission
around Mkn~501, which is consistent with an IGMF with
$B_\mathrm{rms}=1.5_{-0.6}^{+1.6}\times 10^{-15}~\mathrm{G}$ and a coherence
length of $\ell_C=(10\pm 3)~\mathrm{kpc}$. The source needs to actively inject
TeV gamma-rays for at least 45000 years to match the level of secondary
emission. Our results indicate that the secondary gamma-rays are significantly
present in the $\it{Fermi}$-LAT data. The effect of plasma-heating by pairs in
the cascade appears to be negligible for Mkn 501. This is consistent with the
observation that Mkn~501 is one of the objects with the lowest injection power
among the blazars studied in the context of cascade emission.

Motivation: 探索快速射电暴事件率随红移的演化规律，特别是重复与非重复FRB事件率的差异，以了解其宇宙学起源和爆发环境。

Method: 计算不同望远镜在1GHz以上/下频率检测到的重复FRB事件率，使用幂律形式分析光度与红移关系，采用bootstrap方法比较高低频FRB的事件率演化模式。

Result: 发现光度与红移存在正相关幂律演化；重复FRB事件率在红移小于1时超过恒星形成率；低频FRB事件率演化模式与高频不同且更高。

Conclusion: 重复FRB的事件率演化显示明显的宇宙学演化特征，不同频率FRB具有不同的事件率演化模式，这为理解FRB的起源和环境提供了重要线索。

Abstract: How the event rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) evolves with redshift is a hot
topic to explore their cosmological origin and the circum-burst environment.
Particularly, it is urgent to know what the difference of event rates between
repeating and non-repeating FRBs is. For the first time, we calculate the event
rates of repeating FRBs detected by diverse telescopes at frequencies
higher/lower than 1 GHz in this work. Luminosity and redshift are found to be
positively correlated with a power law form for both high- and low-frequency
FRBs, showing an obvious evolution of luminosity with redshift. Furthermore, we
compare the differential luminosity and local event rate distributions of high-
and low-luminosity FRBs at different frequencies. It is found that the event
rates of these sub-samples of repeating FRBs similarly exceed the star
formation rate at lower redshift than 1. Interestingly, we confirm with
bootstrap method that the event rates of low-frequency FRBs exhibit different
evolution patterns and are higher than that of high-frequency ones.

Method: 使用2001-2021年Chandra和XMM-Newton观测数据，进行光谱分析和时序研究，采用双热盘黑体模型、吸积盘+康普顿化模型等多种模型拟合光谱。

Result: 发现耀发状态具有双组分光谱，非耀发状态为单组分光谱；检测到0.96 keV的高斯特征线；估计中心黑洞质量为7.1太阳质量；硬度-光度图显示硬度随光度增加的趋势。

Conclusion: M74 X-1是一个低倾角系统中的恒星质量黑洞，存在超爱丁顿吸积和几何束流效应，光谱特征表明存在双温发射区和可能的流出风。

Abstract: We conducted an extensive long-term spectral and timing study of the
ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) M74 X-1, using data taken between 2001 and
2021 by Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observatories. Our analysis shows that
flares are present in some observations, whereas they are absent in others.
Flaring state exhibits two-component spectra at a lower average flux level,
whereas the non-flaring state displays single-component spectra at a higher
average flux level. The M74 X-1 spectra are best described by the combination
of accretion disk and Comptonization components, a dual thermal disk blackbody
model, and a modified multi-temperature disk blackbody model. Using the dual
thermal disk blackbody model, we obtain cool and hot temperatures of $T_{in}$
(cool) = $0.38^{+0.08}_{-0.06}$ keV and $T_{in}$ (hot) = $1.67^{+0.18}_{-0.13}$
keV, respectively, suggesting two temperature emitting regions and indicating
possible presence of outflowing wind along with the accretion disk. We found a
Gaussian feature at $E_{line}$ = $0.96^{+0.05}_{-0.11}$ keV with $\sigma$ =
$0.11^{+0.13}_{-0.06}$ keV in the spectra of the flaring state which can be
interpreted as the unresolved wind feature in the system when compared to
similar feature seen in other ULXs. Plotting the hardness luminosity diagram,
we get a trend of increasing hardness with luminosity, suggesting the presence
of geometrical beaming in a low-inclination system. Additionally, using the hot
disk blackbody component from the dual thermal disk blackbody model, we
estimate the mass of the compact object to be M = $7.1^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$
M$_\odot$, classifying it as a stellar-mass black hole and confirming
super-Eddington accretion in the system.

Abstract: We analyse the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the eclipsing supersoft
X-ray source CAL 87 covering wavelengths from X-rays to the near-infrared. Our
study incorporates 26 data points across ultraviolet to near-infrared, sourced
from published literature, unpublished data, and new observations. In addition,
archival XMM-Newton spectra were used to represent the X-ray emission. Care was
taken to use out-of-eclipse flux measurements when the irradiated side of the
companion faces the observer. The SED model includes contributions from a
central source, a reprocessed accretion disk, and an irradiated companion star
atmosphere, resulting in a good match to the observed fluxes. The revised and
new parameters for the disk and the central source align with previous studies
and match expectations for such systems. The temperature of the irradiated side
of the companion star was estimated based on its B-V colour during the
secondary eclipse. This work highlights the importance of broad wavelength
coverage for understanding the properties of supersoft X-ray sources.

Conclusion: PIC-MHD混合方法是一种有效的计算手段，能够在可承受的计算成本下研究激波对宇宙射线能谱的贡献机制

Abstract: When supersonic plasma flows collide, many physical processes contribute to
the morphology of the resulting shock. One of these processes is the
acceleration of non-thermal ions, which will, eventually, reach relativistic
speeds and become cosmic rays. This process is difficult to simulate in a
computer model because it requires both macro-physics (the overall shape of the
shock) and micro-physics (the interaction between individual particles and the
magnetic field). The combined PIC-MHD method is one of several options to get
around this problem. It is based on the assumption that a plasma can be
described as a combination of a thermal gas, which can be accurately described
as a fluid using grid-based magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and a small non-thermal
component which has to be described as individual particles using
particle-in-cell (PIC). By combining aspects of both methods, we reduce the
computational costs while maintaining the ability to trace the acceleration of
individual particles. We apply this method to a variety of astrophysical shock
configurations to investigate if, and how, they can contribute to the cosmic
ray spectrum.

Abstract: We present results from the Chandra X-ray Observatory Large Project (878 ks
in 28 observations) of the Large Magellanic Cloud supernova remnant N132D. We
measure the expansion of the forward shock in the bright southern rim to be
$0.\!^{\prime\prime}10 \pm 0.\!^{\prime\prime}02$ over the $\sim14.5$ yr
baseline, which corresponds to a velocity of $1620\pm400~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$
after accounting for several instrumental effects. We measure an expansion of
$0.\!^{\prime\prime}23 \pm 0.\!^{\prime\prime}02$ and a shock velocity of
$3840\pm260~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ for two features in an apparent blowout region
in the northeast. The emission-measure-weighted average temperature inferred
from X-ray spectral fits to regions in the southern rim is $0.95\pm0.17$ keV,
consistent with the electron temperature implied by the shock velocity after
accounting for Coulomb equilibration and adiabatic expansion. In contrast, the
emission-measure-weighted average temperature for the northeast region is
$0.77\pm0.04$ keV, which is significantly lower than the value inferred from
the shock velocity. We fit 1-D evolutionary models for the shock in the
southern rim and northeast region, using the measured radius and propagation
velocity into a constant density and power-law profile circumstellar medium. We
find good agreement with the age of $\sim2500$ years derived from optical
expansion measurements for explosion energies of $1.5-3.0 \times
10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$, ejecta masses of $2-6 \,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and ambient
medium densities of $\sim0.33-0.66$ $\mathrm{amu~cm}^{-3}$ in the south and
$\sim0.01-0.02$ $\mathrm{amu~cm}^{-3}$ in the northeast assuming a constant
density medium. These results are consistent with previous studies that
suggested the progenitor of N132D was an energetic supernova that exploded into
a pre-existing cavity.

Abstract: Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to
identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional
matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal
morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning
approach combining Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave
detection in synthetic data. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency
decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential
for compact binary coalescence identification. The LSTM autoencoder learns
compressed representations while maintaining sensitivity to subtle signal
features distinguishing true astrophysical events from noise artifacts. We
generate realistic synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger
signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses, embedded in colored
Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model
demonstrates strong performance metrics: 92.3 percent precision, 67.6 percent
recall, and 80.6 percent AUC-ROC, with an average precision score of 0.780.
These results exceed LIGO's stringent detection thresholds for confident
gravitational wave identification. Compared to traditional approaches, the
CWT-LSTM autoencoder shows superior ability to maintain low false alarm rates
while preserving sensitivity to weak signals. The method's end-to-end learning
eliminates hand-crafted features and template banks, offering a promising
pathway toward more robust gravitational wave detection systems. The
unsupervised nature enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies,
providing complementary "blind search" capability for detecting exotic
astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.

Motivation: 传统周光关系需要多历元观测来确定周期和充分采样光变曲线，但单历元观测更实用且观测成本更低。然而单历元观测会引入更大的光度散射，导致周光关系分散度增加。

Conclusion: 这种校正方法能够准确重建空间设施观测波段的平均光周光关系，在观测历元数量有限的情况下提供优于简单平均或模板拟合的解决方案。

Abstract: The Period-Luminosity (PL) relation is usually derived using time-averaged
magnitudes, which require multiple-epoch observations to determine periods and
adequately sample the light curves. Although single-epoch observations are more
practical and require significantly less observational effort, they inherently
introduce greater photometric scatter, leading to an increased dispersion in
the derived Period-Luminosity relations. In this paper, we explore, in detail,
a method that transforms single random-phase data to their mean-light values,
using information obtained in other bands for the same Cepheid. This approach
enables the accurate re-construction of mean-light PL relations for wavelengths
observed with space-based facilities, for instance, where the number of epochs
per star makes simple averaging or template fitting less than optimal, with the
latter requiring very high-precision periods for predictive phasing. While
applying this technique across multiple bands, from optical to mid-IR, we focus
particularly on widely separated bands covering the mid-IR to the optical. We
showcase this method using the J band (as being observed by JWST) as the
random-phase component. Our results show that this correction reduces the
scatter of the PL relation in the J band by a factor of approximately
$0.7\times$, equivalent to increasing the number of random-phase observations
by a factor of 10, needed to obtain the same increase in precision as delivered
here.

Result: 实现了完整的联合后验分布访问，能够处理绝对通量校准（外部源或内部信号注入），避免了传统DFT噪声协方差假设导致的时间域伪周期性相关

Conclusion: 该框架和技术可推广到互相关和干涉测量数据，虽然演示针对自相关测量，但具有良好的可扩展性和计算效率

Abstract: Line intensity maps have high dynamic range, and demand careful spectral and
spatial calibration. We present a Bayesian framework for joint calibration and
map-making using Gibbs sampling, which provides access to the full joint
posterior of calibration and sky map parameters. Our data model incorporates
instrumental noise based on the radiometer equation, capturing the coupling
between noise level and system temperature without assuming a fixed noise
amplitude. To enable unbiased and fast estimation of gain and system
temperature, we develop an iterative generalised least squares (GLS) sampling
method. Absolute flux calibration can be achieved either with external sources
or internally using known signal injections, such as noise diodes. To handle
stochastic gain variations, we introduce a $1/f$ noise model that avoids
spurious periodic correlations in the time domain caused by the conventional
assumption of diagonal DFT noise covariance. Furthermore, we implement this
workflow in an efficient software package, using the Levinson algorithm and a
polynomial emulator to reduce the computational complexity of noise parameter
sampling, ensuring good scalability. Although demonstrated for auto-correlation
measurements, the framework and techniques generalise to cross-correlation and
interferometric data.

Abstract: We present a technique to search for fast radio bursts in records obtained
with broadband radiometers having few radio channels. The technique is applied
to the RATAN-600 surveys carried out at its Western Sector since the year 2017.
A 1D convolutional neural network for multichannel time series classification
is developed based on the EfficientNet family of models. The procedure to
generate synthetic FRB signals needed for the training dataset is described. We
implement a two-stage cascade scheme to effectively suppress the rate of false
positive detections. Evaluation of the trained model is provided based on the
synthetic events and the giant pulse of the Crab Pulsar.

TL;DR: 月球遮挡导致银河前景模型误差，使21厘米信号恢复误差增加20-115%，需避免特定月球对齐场景；金星等小天体影响可忽略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探测宇宙氢原子超精细跃迁的21厘米信号对理解早期宇宙状态至关重要，但强银河前景干扰使得信号检测困难。当前的前向建模技术需要精确的前景理解，而月球等天体的遮挡会导致前景模型不匹配，影响信号恢复精度

Method: 通过构建玩具模型，分析月球遮挡导致的银河前景模型误差（15-180 ppm），评估其对21厘米信号恢复的影响程度。比较不同天体（如金星）的遮挡效应

Result: 月球遮挡导致15 ppm的前景模型误差会使信号恢复误差增加20%；在银河中心和高天线方向性区域对齐时，误差可达180 ppm，导致115%的信号恢复误差。金星等小天体影响很小（<2 ppm）

Conclusion: 月球遮挡会显著破坏21厘米信号恢复，需要主动避免特定的月球对齐场景。较小天体如金星的遮挡影响可以忽略，为观测策略提供了重要指导

Abstract: The global 21 cm signal from the hyperfine transition of cosmic atomic
hydrogen is theorised to track the state of the early Universe via the analysis
of its absorption and emission with respect to the radio background. Detecting
this signal has been a challenge for astronomers since it was first postulated
due to the presence of strong galactic foregrounds obfuscating the transition.
Forward modelling techniques that aim to simulate and then remove these
foregrounds have been suggested as a workaround to this problem. This
technique, however, requires a precise and accurate understanding of the
foregrounds in question. As we move into the next major lunar standstill, the
moon will be able to occult high power areas of the sky in ways that are
unaccounted for by maps used to simulate these foregrounds, and thereby disrupt
signal recovery. We show that in toy cases an occultation from the moon, or
other proximate object, leading to a mismatch in our expected and actual
foregrounds of 15 parts per million increases the error in signal recovery of
up to 20\%. We show that this level of disruption can happen when the moon is
found towards the centre of the galaxy and is amplified when this alignment
happens at high directivity regions of the antenna beam, causing a disruption
of up to 180 parts per million, leading to a signal recovery error of 115\%.
This allows us to identify lunar alignment scenarios that should be actively
avoided to preserve signal fidelity. We also demonstrate that a body with a
smaller apparent size than the moon, such as Venus, is unlikely to cause any
signal disruption due to occultation, giving a base map error of <2 parts per
million.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用21cm全球信号数据对Haslam 408 MHz全天图进行统计重新校准的吉布斯采样方法，以修正该地图中存在的通量尺度误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Haslam 408 MHz全天图被广泛用作射电和微波频率下银河系同步辐射的模板，但近期研究表明该地图存在未校正的大尺度通量误差，需要寻找方法来修正这些误差。

Method: 构建吉布斯采样方案，通过联合分析1度分辨率的408 MHz弥散图和30度分辨率的多波段21cm全球信号数据，恢复约50,000个参数的全联合后验分布，包括真实天空亮度温度场、未校正的通量尺度因子和同步辐射幂律谱指数。

Result: 在基准情景下（全球信号实验在50-150 MHz的20个频率通道中每个粗像素的噪声均方根为50 mK），能够在大多数天空子区域将Haslam通量尺度因子恢复到±2%的精度，所有情况下都能将天空图修正到与真实亮度温度相差约5K以内。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用低分辨率但绝对校准的21cm全球信号数据来统计重新校准Haslam地图，显著提高其通量尺度精度，为银河系同步辐射研究提供更可靠的模板。

Abstract: The Haslam 408 MHz all-sky map is widely used as a template to model the
diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission at radio and microwave frequencies.
Recent studies have suggested that there are large uncorrected flux scale
errors in this map, however. We investigate the possibility of statistically
recalibrating the Haslam map using absolutely-calibrated (but low angular
resolution) radio experiments designed to measure the 21cm global signal at low
frequencies. We construct a Gibbs sampling scheme to recover the full joint
posterior distribution of $\sim 50,000$ parameters, representing the true sky
brightness temperature field, as-yet uncorrected flux scale factors, and
synchrotron power-law spectral indices. Using idealised full-sky simulated
data, we perform a joint analysis of a $1^\circ$ resolution diffuse map at 408
MHz and multi-band 21cm global signal data with $30^\circ$ resolution under
different assumptions about 1) noise levels in the maps, 2) sky coverage, and
3) synchrotron spectral index information. For our fiducial scenario in which
the global signal experiment has a 50 mK noise rms per coarse pixel in each of
20 frequency bins between 50 -- 150 MHz, we find that the notional Haslam flux
scale factors can be recovered in most (but not all) sub-regions of the sky to
an accuracy of $\pm 2 \%$. In all cases we are able to rectify the sky map to
within $\sim 5$ K of the true brightness temperature.
